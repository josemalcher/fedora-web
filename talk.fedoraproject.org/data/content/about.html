    <h2>${_('About Fedora Talk')}</h2>
    <p>${_('Fedora Talk is an effort to bring Fedora contributors in closer contact to each other.  IRC is an OK tool for communication but meetings and conversations bring much more to the table.')}</p>
    <h2>${_('What makes Fedora Talk work?')}</h2>
    <p>${_('Fedora Talk is just an Asterisk install.  For a VOIP solution it is hard to do better then Asterisk.  Also being completely Free and Open Source Software, Asterisk fits in very well with the core beliefs of Fedora.  Software is just one aspect of this project.  Many volunteers have come together to help configure and test the install.  Hosting and bandwidth has been provided by Server Beach.  The dial in numbers (DiDs) have been provided by Arrival Telecom.  Every aspect of this project has been community and volunteer oriented.')}</p>
