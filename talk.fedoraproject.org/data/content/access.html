    <h2>${_('Accessing to Fedora Talk')}</h2>
    <p>${_('Fedora Talk is provided to all Fedora Contributors.  Each participating contributor is given a 7 digit extension that starts with the number 5.  To get access users need to enable VOIP in the Fedora Accounts System as well as set their VOIP password')}</p>
    <h3>${_('Step 1')}</h3>
    <p>${Markup(_('Sign up for a &lt;a href="https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts/"&gt;Fedora Account&lt;/a&gt;, and ensure that you have signed the CLA at the account site.  Most Fedora contributors will have already done this'))}</p>
    <h3>${_('Step 2')}</h3>
    <p>${Markup(_('Enable Asterisk by clicking on the &lt;a href="https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts/asterisk/"&gt;VOIP&lt;/a&gt; link in the account system.  Then edit your profile.  Enable Asterisk as well as set an Asterisk Password.  It can take for up to an hour for your changes to be realized by Asterisk.  Now is also a good time to see what your extension is (on the VOIP main page in the account system).  Make a note of it.'))}</p>
    <h3>${_('Step 3')}</h3>
    <p>${_('All set.  The easy part is done.  After the user has been sent to the talk server users should be able to log in.  All that is left is to configure a Software Phone like twinkle and ekiga, or configuring a SIP compliant VOIP phone.')}</p>
