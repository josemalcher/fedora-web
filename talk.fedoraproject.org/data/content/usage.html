		<li>${_('Do test your connection in sip:infrastructure@fedoraproject.org. Ask someone in #fedora-admin to connect and verify your settings.')}</li>
		<li>${_('Do use mute when you are not talking (it is preferred you use mute on the sip client and not through other means unless you are confident in your settings.  It is possible for your sound system to loop back into itself.)')}</li>
