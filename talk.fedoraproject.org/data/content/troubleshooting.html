    <h3>${_("Can't connect")}</h3>
	<p>${_('Being unable to connect is a common issue. Try the following solutions')}:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>${_('Disable your firewalls (If it starts working, then you need to re-configure your firewall)')}</li>
		<li>${_('Try to connect to @talk.fedoraproject.org instead of @fedoraproject.org')}</li>
		<li>${_("Sometimes a client (like ekiga) might bind to an interface it shouldn't. Please verify it is using a valid and proper interface.")}
			<ul>
				<li>${_('Ekiga - "Edit -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Protocols -&gt; Network Settings -&gt; "Listen on".')}</li>
				<li>${_('Twinkle - "Edit -&gt; System Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Default Network Interface"')}</li>

	<h3>${_("Can't hear anything")}</h3>
	<p>${_("First ensure that you have your audio configured properly and it isn't muted. Just try to play a song or find some other means to make noise. These issues are typically on the client. To test audio please join")}:</p>
	<p>${_('sip:conferences@fedoraproject.org')}</p>
	<p>${_('You should hear a female voice asking for your conference ID. If you do, just hang up.')}</p>
	<h3>${_('No one can hear me')}</h3>
	<p>${_("Having a mic configured in properly is a bit of an art. Ensure that you can record your own audio using something like audacity. If you'd like to test your mic, just stop by #fedora-admin on irc.freenode.net and we'll be happy to assist.")}</p>
	<h3>${_('Echoing')}</h3>
	<p>${_('There are a few common issues that lead to echoing. The most common of which is not using a headset and microphone. Using actual speakers on your laptop or desktop will cause your mic (sometimes embedded in your computer) will pick up the audio again. Unfortunately testing for this yourself is difficult. If you hear someone complaining please mute yourself or drop the call until you can re-configure.')}</p>
	<p>${_('Another common problem that leads to horrible echoing is from your sound system looping back on itself. This issue actually makes the conference unusable. If you join and people start complaining about an echo, please mute yourself or drop the call so those in the meeting can continue.')}</p>
	<h3>${_("Ekiga dialpad doesn't work")}</h3>
	<p>${_('Try disabling silence detection in your audio configuration.  With silence detection enabled, the dialpad may not send tones properly.  Furthermore, the ekiga dialpad is prone to sending repeat tones which makes it difficult to enter PINs properly.')}</p>
