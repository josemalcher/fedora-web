	<h3>${_('Echoing')}</h3>
	<p>${_('There are a few common issues that lead to echoing. The most common of which is not using a headset and microphone. Using actual speakers on your laptop or desktop will cause your mic (sometimes embedded in your computer) will pick up the audio again. Unfortunately testing for this yourself is difficult. If you hear someone complaining please mute yourself or drop the call until you can re-configure.')}</p>
	<p>${_('Another common problem that leads to horrible echoing is from your sound system looping back on itself. This issue actually makes the conference unusable. If you join and people start complaining about an echo, please mute yourself or drop the call so those in the meeting can continue.')}</p>
	<p>${_('Do not use a mic that is not on a headset - the reason for this is when you do, your mic will pick up other sounds that are in the same room, for example the sounds of you typing on the keyboard, the sound of your computer fan, etc. This makes the conference unusable for other participants. If someone reports excessive noise, please either mute your line or drop off the conference.')}</p>
	<h3>${_("Ekiga dialpad doesn't work")}</h3>
	<p>${_('Try disabling silence detection in your audio configuration.  With silence detection enabled, the dialpad may not send tones properly.  Furthermore, the ekiga dialpad is prone to sending repeat tones which makes it difficult to enter PINs properly.')}</p>
