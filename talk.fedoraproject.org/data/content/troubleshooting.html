    <h3>${_("Can't connect")}</h3>
	<p>${_('Being unable to connect is a common issue. Try the following solutions')}:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>${_('Disable your firewalls (If it starts working, then you need to re-configure your firewall)')}</li>
		<li>${_('Try to connect to @talk.fedoraproject.org instead of @fedoraproject.org')}</li>
		<li>${_("Sometimes a client (like ekiga) might bind to an interface it shouldn't. Please verify it is using a valid and proper interface.")}

	<h3>${_("Can't hear anything")}</h3>
	<p>${_("First ensure that you have your audio configured properly and it isn't muted. Just try to play a song or find some other means to make noise. These issues are typically on the client. To test audio please join")}:</p>
	<p>${_('sip:conferences@fedoraproject.org')}</p>
	<p>${_('You should hear a female voice asking for your conference ID. If you do, just hang up.')}</p>
	<h3>${_('No one can hear me')}</h3>
	<p>${_("You should verify that the system is properly receiving audio from the microphone. In GNOME, you can do this by right clicking on the speaker icon in the notification area, going to the input tab, and verifying the input level that you are seeing. If you have multiple microphones, for example a USB headset and an internal microphone, make sure that the raido button is selected on the correct one.")}</p>
	<p>${_("Having a mic configured in properly is a bit of an art. Ensure that you can record your own audio using something like audacity. If you'd like to test your mic, just stop by #fedora-admin on irc.freenode.net and we'll be happy to assist.")}</p>
	<h3>${_('Echoing')}</h3>
	<p>${_('There are a few common issues that lead to echoing. The most common of which is not using a headset and microphone. Using actual speakers on your laptop or desktop will cause your mic (sometimes embedded in your computer) will pick up the audio again. Unfortunately testing for this yourself is difficult. If you hear someone complaining please mute yourself or drop the call until you can re-configure.')}</p>
	<p>${_('Another common problem that leads to horrible echoing is from your sound system looping back on itself. This issue actually makes the conference unusable. If you join and people start complaining about an echo, please mute yourself or drop the call so those in the meeting can continue.')}</p>
	<p>${_('Do not use a mic that is not on a headset - the reason for this is when you do, your mic will pick up other sounds that are in the same room, for example the sounds of you typing on the keyboard, the sound of your computer fan, etc. This makes the conference unusable for other participants. If someone reports excessive noise, please either mute your line or drop off the conference.')}</p>
	<h3>${_("I can make calls, but not receive them")}</h3>
	<p>${_("This generally indicates that your phone is not registered with the Asterisk server. Note that registration does not affect your ability to make calls, only to receive them. In development is a way to tell whether you are registered, and what that registration consists of, but at current, come to #fedora-admin on irc.freenode.net and we'll be more than happy to help!")}</p>
	<h3>${_("Ekiga dialpad doesn't work")}</h3>
	<p>${_('Try disabling silence detection in your audio configuration.  With silence detection enabled, the dialpad may not send tones properly.  Furthermore, the ekiga dialpad is prone to sending repeat tones which makes it difficult to enter PINs properly.')}</p>
	<h3>${_("Test numbers")}</h3>
	<p>${_('There are a variety test numbers that you can use to verify your Fedora Talk setup')}</p>
	   <ul>
	   <li>1001 - <a href="sip:louie@fedoraproject.org">louie</a> - ${_('Louie Louie - You should hear a female voice reciting the lyrics to Louie Louie - this is testing the ability for you to receive one way audio')}</li>
	   <li>1002 - <a href="sip:echo@fedoraproject.orgi">echo</a> - ${_('Echo - this simply echos everything that you say back to you. This tests that two way audio is functional')}</li>
