msgid "Fedora Talk is an effort to bring Fedora contributors in closer contact to each other.  IRC is an OK tool for communication but meetings and conversations bring much more to the table."
msgstr "Fedora Talk 主要是為了集合所有 Fedora 貢獻者並拉近彼此的距離。對於通訊上來講，IRC 已足夠，不過當進行開會與對話時則可能需要透過其它較佳的方式。"

#: data/content/about.html:15
msgid "Fedora Talk is just an Asterisk install.  For a VOIP solution it is hard to do better then Asterisk.  Also being completely Free and Open Source Software, Asterisk fits in very well with the core beliefs of Fedora.  Software is just one aspect of this project.  Many volunteers have come together to help configure and test the install.  Hosting and bandwidth has been provided by Server Beach.  The dial in numbers (DiDs) have been provided by Arrival Telecom.  Every aspect of this project has been community and volunteer oriented."
msgstr "Fedora Talk 只是個 Asterisk 安裝。以 VOIP 方案來講，要超越 Asterisk 是相當困難的。此外，身為自由與開放式軟體的 Asterisk 能適當地融入 Fedora 的核心價值。軟體只是此專案的一部分。許多志願者都集結在一起協助配置和測試安裝。Hosting 和頻寬是由 Server Beach 所提供的。撥接號碼（dial in numbers，DiDs）則是由 Arrival Telecom 所提供的。此專案的每一部份都是經由社群和志願導向的方式來架構而成的。"

Without it you will be difficult or impossible to understand.  It is important to remember that background noise and misconfigured or poorly configured callers can completely destroy a conference call."
msgstr "除了至少擁有一部含有網際網路存取權限的電腦之外，我們也建議您使用一副含有麥克風的耳機。若缺少了這副耳機，要了解通訊內容將會相當困難。請注意，背景噪音和錯誤設定或非充分的配置的撥接程式都能造成會議通訊完全地被破壞。"
