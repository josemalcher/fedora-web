msgid ""
"Fedora Talk is just an Asterisk install.  For a VOIP solution it is hard "
"to do better then Asterisk.  Also being completely Free and Open Source "
"Software, Asterisk fits in very well with the core beliefs of Fedora.  "
"Software is just one aspect of this project.  Many volunteers have come "
"together to help configure and test the install.  Hosting and bandwidth "
"has been provided by Server Beach.  The dial in numbers (DiDs) have been "
"provided by Arrival Telecom.  Every aspect of this project has been "
"community and volunteer oriented."
