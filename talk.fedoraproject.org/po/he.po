#: data/content/troubleshooting.html:33
msgid ""
"There are a few common issues that lead to echoing. The most common of which"
" is not using a headset and microphone. Using actual speakers on your laptop"
" or desktop will cause your mic (sometimes embedded in your computer) will "
"pick up the audio again. Unfortunately testing for this yourself is "
"difficult. If you hear someone complaining please mute yourself or drop the "
"call until you can re-configure."

#: data/content/troubleshooting.html:34
msgid ""
"Another common problem that leads to horrible echoing is from your sound "
"system looping back on itself. This issue actually makes the conference "
"unusable. If you join and people start complaining about an echo, please "
"mute yourself or drop the call so those in the meeting can continue."
msgstr ""

#: data/content/troubleshooting.html:35
msgid ""
"Do not use a mic that is not on a headset - the reason for this is when you "
"do, your mic will pick up other sounds that are in the same room, for "
"example the sounds of you typing on the keyboard, the sound of your computer"
" fan, etc. This makes the conference unusable for other participants. If "
"someone reports excessive noise, please either mute your line or drop off "
