"Using the ISO file provided for the spin you're interested in, you can "
"create a CD or DVD that will boot into the spin when you insert it into a "
"computer and turn it on or reboot. Alternatively, using that same ISO file, "
"you can also create a bootable USB stick which will also boot into the spin "
"when you insert it into a computer and turn it on or reboot."

"One thing to remember when you run a spin off of a CD or DVD is that as you "
"use the system, any additional applications you install will not be there "
"when you reboot your computer - there isn't any way to work around this "
"because you cannot write out to bootable CD or DVD media. Additionally, any "
"files you save will be lost when you reboot because Fedora runs off of the "
"media, it doesn't access your hard drive.. When using CD or DVD bootable "
"spins, you should always make sure you save your files to an external device"
" such as a USB key or USB hard drive. (<a "

"When you use a USB stick to boot your spin, you have an extra option to save"
" some of the disk space on the USB stick as permanent storage. If you choose"
" to create the media for your spin this way, then any applications you've "
"install on your running spin, and any files you save to disk will still be "
"present when you reboot your computer, as long as you don't go over the "
"amount of available free space on your USB stick. (<a "

"ahead and commit my packages to the project in order to maintain them so "
"that (hopefully) others could benefit. From there I became consumed, the "
"more I got involved the more I loved the project. All the values, goals, and"

"This paper entails how the Fedora Project encourages Research and "
"Development in advanced electronics design through its Fedora Electronic "
"Laboratory (FEL) platform. Fedora has opted a different approach in the "
"development of such high-end hardware design and simulation platform. This "
"approach focuses mainly on providing opensource EDA solutions to meet "
"several high-end design flows and methodologies, rather than the traditional"
" opensource method: random packaging process."

"In one of the largest technological parks in the world, Laurent, with more "
"than 15 years of experience in digital IC design, gave a presentation about "
"HDL design, simulation and PCB design with free and opensource EDA software."
" His audience, mostly Electronic Engineers from local semiconductor "
"companies (Infineon, Texas-Instruments, ST-Ericsson, ...), were very pleased"
" to know about the FEL initiative and happy to learn that it is now easier "
"to find opensource tools that are ready to use. At the booth, Laurent gave "
"some outstanding demos of Kicad (PCB), KtechLab (simulation) and other "
"tools."
