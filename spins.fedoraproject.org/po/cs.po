msgid "Using the ISO file provided for the spin you're interested in, you can create a CD or DVD that will boot into the spin when you insert it into a computer and turn it on or reboot. Alternatively, using that same ISO file, you can also create a bootable USB stick which will also boot into the spin when you insert it into a computer and turn it on or reboot."

#: data/content/about.html:21
msgid "One thing to remember when you run a spin off of a CD or DVD is that as you use the system, any additional applications you install will not be there when you reboot your computer - there isn't any way to work around this because you cannot write out to bootable CD or DVD media. Additionally, any files you save will be lost when you reboot because Fedora runs off of the media, it doesn't access your hard drive.. When using CD or DVD bootable spins, you should always make sure you save your files to an external device such as a USB key or USB hard drive.

msgid "The Sugar Learning Environment gives students access to a thriving community-created ecosystem of software Activities designed to achieve specific pedagogical goals. Activities range from physics simulators and interactive speech synthesis for beginning readers to tools for remixing open content into customized digital libraries for your local classroom. Sugar automatically saves your progress to a \"Journal\" on your stick, so teachers and parents can easily pull up \"all collaborative web browsing sessions done in the past week\" or \"papers written with Daniel and Sarah in the last 24 hours\" with a simple query rather than memorizing complex file/folder structures. The source code for each Activity is available right from the application itself with the \"View Source\" feature, meaning that students can see exactly how their favorite applications work - and perhaps how to make them even better. And an international community of learners, teachers, deployers, and developers is always there to help classrooms turn their feedback and ideas for improvement into reality."
