"This paper entails how the Fedora Project encourages Research and "
"Development in advanced electronics design through its Fedora Electronic "
"Laboratory (FEL) platform. Fedora has opted a different approach in the "
"development of such high-end hardware design and simulation platform. This "
"approach focuses mainly on providing opensource EDA solutions to meet "
"several high-end design flows and methodologies, rather than the traditional"
" opensource method: random packaging process."

"HDL design, simulation and PCB design with free and opensource EDA software."
" His audience, mostly Electronic Engineers from local semiconductor "
"companies (Infineon, Texas-Instruments, ST-Ericsson, ...), were very pleased"
" to know about the FEL initiative and happy to learn that it is now easier "
"to find opensource tools that are ready to use. At the booth, Laurent gave "
