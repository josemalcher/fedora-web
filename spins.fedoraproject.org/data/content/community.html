		<h4>Chitlesh Goorah, Fedora Electronic Lab</h4>
		<p>${_('"At the very beginning, there was neither the intention for a Fedora Electronic Lab nor its spin. During my post-graduate studies in Micro-Nano Electronic Engineering, I needed VLSI simulation tools. I started packaging the VLSI simulation tools for Fedora, which I needed for my studies. Then MirjamWaeckerlin and my lecturers in Strasbourg, France, encouraged the concept of introducing Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) Design Flows on Fedora, so that they can recommend to other students or use those tools themselves."')}<br /><a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Interviews/FEL">${_('Read more of this interview with Chiltesh &gt;')}</a></p>
