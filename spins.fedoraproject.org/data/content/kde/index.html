				<h3>Desktop</h3>
				<h4>Plasma</h4>
				<p>Plasma provides the desktop interface for KDE 4, including the application launcher (start menu), the desktop and the desktop panel (often referred to simply as the task bar).</p>
				<img class="within-text" src="/static/images/content/kde-screenshot-01-sm.png" rel="#plasma1" />
				<p>You can use Plasma as you would use the desktop of any other operating system, by accessing the application menu (K Menu), viewing the currently active programs on the taskbar, accessing icons on the system tray, and so on.</p>
				<p>An important part of Plasma are the so-called widgets, and the customization these widgets allow. Widgets are the individual units of the desktop and they include the application menu, icons, the system tray, the clock, along with countless other widgets. Widgets can exist on the desktop itself, or be inserted in the panel. Panels and desktops are actually special kinds of widgets, meant to contain other widgets (in Plasma terms, they are called "Containments").</p>
				<p>More info available at <a href="http://userbase.kde.org/Plasma">http://userbase.kde.org/Plasma</a></p>
				<h4>Desktop Effects</h4>
				<p>Kwin (the default KDE window manager) supports this cool compositing effects like the Desktop Cube Animation, where each virtual desktop is displayed on a side of a cube. Wobbly windows, which can explode when they are closed or fall apart. And of course lots more interesting effects.</p>
				<p>Enjoy one of the example videos here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arZSxLuwv_E">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arZSxLuwv_E</a></p>
				<p><strong>Note</strong>: Desktop effects are not enabled by default! You need a supported graphics card and to enable it in the System settings -&gt; Desktop configuration tool.</p>
