                Fedora's Electronic Laboratory empowers you with an advanced 
                opensource electronic design and simulation platform for 
                micro-nano electronics engineering.  FEL is dedicated to 
                support the innovation and development brought by opensource 
                Electronic Design Automation (EDA) community.
                </p>

                <p>
                Fedora Electronic Lab is free. No licenses required. No kernel 
                patches are required, making it easy to deploy and use in 
                production environment.

                Fedora's Electronic Laboratory, an opensource hardware design 
                and simulation platform, is dedicated to support the innovation 
                and development brought by opensource Electronic Design 
                Automation (EDA) community.
                </p>
                <p>
                Fedora Electronic Laboratory provides a complete electronic 
                laboratory setup with reliable open source design tools in 
                order to help you keep in pace with current technological race.  
                It reduces the risk assessment of open source hardware 
                development and enable electronic designers tapeout quickly and 
                efficiently.
