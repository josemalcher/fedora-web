	  ${Markup(_('Three years ago, &lt;a href=""&gt;Chitlesh Goorah&lt;/a&gt; proposed "Fedora Electronic Lab" to the Fedora community by providing existing opensource EDA tools for ASIC design. The main objective was to ensure that all the opensource EDA tools can exchange data between them (ensuring at least a basic design flow). Since each of the design tool were being developed individually each has its own storage mechanism (make it difficult for interoperability). Thereby Fedora worked with various upstream developers to shape their EDA tools so that universities or small companies can opt for these tools.'))}<br /><br />

	  ${_('Compiling each of these tools individually and building his/her own design flow at home is very difficult. Thereby with Fedora Electronic Lab, users will only use the tools instead of compiling it from scratch. Fedora Electronic Lab follows the industry trends with what is available on the opensource ecosystem. Hence FEL users will benefit from such deployment infrastructure for free and quickly.')}<br /><br />
