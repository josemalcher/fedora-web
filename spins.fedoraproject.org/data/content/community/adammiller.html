<p><em>${Markup(_('Adam Miller is the maintainer of the &lt;a href="%s"&gt;Fedora Xfce Desktop spin&lt;/a&gt;. Learn more about his background, how he got involved in Xfce, and why he thinks it\'s worth checking out!' % relpath+'/xfce'))}</em></p>
<h4>${_('Where are you from?')}</h4>
<p>
${_('Originally from Houston, TX (USA). Now in Huntsville, TX (USA) for my masters and I work at the university I am attending.')}
</p>
<h4>${_('What is your profession?')}</h4>
<p>${_('I am a Red Hat Enterprise Linux server administrator for my dayjob.')}</p>

<h4>${_('What\'s your IRC nick?')}</h4>
<p>${_('maxamillion on Freenode.')}</p>

<h4>${_('Can you explain to our readers a little bit about what Xfce is and why they might want to give it a try?')}</h4>
<p>${_('Xfce is an open source desktop environment with the goals to be simple and fast, it is a wonderful solution to making your desktop environment faster while still being extremely customizable and feature rich. Xfce has a very clean interface, it\'s simple but not so simple that its lacking, and it has an overall professional feel to it.')}</p>

<h4>${_('What are your top three favorite features in Xfce?')}</h4>
<ol>
<li>${_('First and foremost, the window manager. I don\'t know why but it seems to fit me perfectly and I can\'t find another that suites my needs in the same way. It\'s fast, stable, and it offers compositing for a little eye candy.')}</li>
<li>${_('The terminal; Xfce Terminal is where I spend roughly 85%% of my time on a computer and while I know it might sound silly, I\'m just a really big fan of Xfce Terminal over other similar products.') % ()}</li>
<li>${_('Thunar, the Xfce default file manager is extremely fast, user friendly and it has a very clean/simplistic interface which I\'m a really big fan of.')}</li>
</ol>
<h4>${_('How did you first get involved with the Xfce spin?')}</h4>
<p>
${_('I started as a user to be honest, I used the Xfce spin as soon as I learned about what the Spins where (because I\'ve been a fan of Xfce for years) and from there I simply asked what needed doing. I started by helping test, clean up the wiki when needed, and just offer up any help I was able to provide.')}
</p>
<h4>${_('How does the Fedora Xfce SIG work? Is it a big SIG? How do you divide the work?')}</h4>
<p>${_('We are actually a very small SIG, we don\'t have a mailing list or an irc channel but we do get most work done in irc and email (yes, sounds like voodoo magic). We generally hang out in #fedora-devel for development purposes, attend Spins SIG meetings, and email one another when others aren\'t on irc for on-going discussions.')}</p>
<h4>${_('How much contact do you have with Xfce upstream?')}</h4>
<p>${_('I personally send as much feedback upstream as I am able and the others in the Xfce SIG do as well, if not more than myself. Any time we find a bug we are sure to send it upstream and the scenario is similar for patches. Though I will admit that in my time in the Xfce SIG there has only been a need for 1 bug report upstream and it was a duplicate so upstream was already working on it. Aside from that I am a member of the Xfce development and "goodies" mailing lists in order to keep myself involved and up to date as much as possible. If I had the spare time, I\'d actually like to get involved helping along with their upstream development but it\'s just not possible at the moment.')}</p>
<h4>${_('How did you first get involved with Fedora?')}</h4>
<p>${_('This is honestly a long story but I will try to summarize. I started with a boxed set of Red Hat 7.0 Deluxe Workstation, from there I was an avid Red Hat user until the split of Red Hat and Fedora. I ventured off into the world for a while trying out different distros and I eventually made my way back to the Red Hat/Fedora world around the release of Fedora 7. At that time I got my current job and I started needing to package software for our RHEL servers and since we were already using Fedora EPEL, I decided to go ahead and commit my packages to the project in order to maintain them so that (hopefully) others could benefit. From there I became consumed, the more I got involved the more I loved the project. All the values, goals, and passion that is put forth by the project as a whole is what really got me to jump in and contribute. Then I found my way to the Xfce SIG, the rest is a blur and here I am today.')}</p>
<p>${_('My interest in free software was sparked in my high school computer science class because I had a strange passion for wanting to know how software worked, I had very limited knowledge so there wasn\'t a lot of source I could really follow but my teacher at the time suggested I pick up a copy of RedHat (which is where the previously mentioned boxed set came from) and from there I was hooked. The concept of the global computer science community working on code, doing peer review, innovating, and making progress all out in the open just puts a smile on my face.')}</p>
<h4> ${_('What do you like to do in the time you\'re not working on Fedora?')}</h4>
<p>${_('I\'m currently working on my Masters Degree in Computer Science so when I\'m not working on Fedora, working on school or working my day job I like to go to the gym, play video games, or spend time with my fiancé.')} </p>
