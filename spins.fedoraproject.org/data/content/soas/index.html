				<p>${_('Sugar on a Stick is a Fedora-based operating system featuring the award-winning &lt;a href="http://sugarlabs.org/"&gt;Sugar Learning Platform&lt;/a&gt; and designed to fit on an ordinary USB thumbdrive (&quot;stick&quot;). Originally developed for the &lt;a href="http://laptop.org"&gt;One Laptop Per Child Project&lt;/a&gt; and designed specifically as a 1-to-1 computing environment for K-8 students to collaborate with others in exploring the world around them, Sugar is used every day by over one and a half million students in classrooms throughout the world. It is now deployable for the cost of a stick rather than a laptop; students can take their Sugar on a Stick thumbdrive to any machine - at school, at home, at a library or community center - and boot their customized computing environment without touching the host machine&rsquo;s hard disk or existing system at all.')}</p>
				<p>${_('The heart of the Sugar Learning Platform is its Activities for children - fun and engaging programs for reading e-books, writing, drawing, browsing the Internet, programming, and so on. Each Activity is designed to achieve specific pedagogical goals.')}</p>
				<p>${_('A thriving community-created ecosystem of Activities can be found at the &lt;a href="http://activities.sugarlabs.org/"&gt;Sugar Labs Activities Portal&lt;/a&gt;. Activities take full advantage of computer-based learning, from interactive speech synthesis for beginning readers to tools for remixing open content into customized digital libraries for your local classroom.')}</p>

				<p>${_('The source code for each Activity is available right from the application itself with the &quot;View Source&quot; feature, meaning that students can see exactly how their favorite applications work - and perhaps how to make them even better. Tinkering encouraged! An international community of learners, teachers, deployers, and developers is always there to help classrooms turn their &lt;a href="mailto:feedback@sugarlabs.org"&gt;feedback&lt;/a&gt; and ideas for improvement into reality.')}</p>

				<h2>${_('About')}</h2>
				<h3>${_('What is Sugar on a Stick?')}</h3>
				<p>${_('Information is about nouns. Learning is about verbs. Designed specifically for children and based on cognitive and social constructivism, the Sugar user interface differs from traditional user interfaces with their "office productivity" orientation. To see the difference for yourself, check out the &lt;a href="http://www.sugarlabs.org/assets/sugar_demo.ogg"&gt;guided video tour&lt;/a&gt;.')}</p>
				<p>${_('The fourth Sugar on a Stick release, &quot;Mango Lassi&quot;, is a slim, stable version of the Sugar Learning Platform featuring a few classroom-tested Activities and designed for remixability and customization by adventurous students, families, and small classroom deployments who want to try something different and help shape the future of personalized learning for children around the world.')}</p>
				<h3>${_('Our principles')}</h3>
				<h4>${_('The Sugar Learning Platform')}</h4>
				<p>${_('Two Principles define the Sugar Learning Platform:')}</p>
				<ul>
					<li>${_('We learn through doing, so if we want more learning, we want more doing.')}</li>
					<li>${_('Love is a better master than duty - you want people to engage in things that are authentic to them, things that they love. Internal motivation almost always trumps external motivations.')}</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>${_('The Design of Sugar')}</h4>
				<p>${_('Three experiences characterize the design of Sugar:')}</p>
				<span class="blurb"><img src="/static/images/content/soas-screenshot-02-sm.png" rel="#soas2" /><br />${_('Click image to enlarge')}</span>
				<ul>
					<li>${_('Discovering: Sugar can accommodate a wide variety of users, with different levels of skill in terms of reading, language, and different levels of experience with computing. It is easy to approach, yet it doesn&rsquo;t put an upper bound on personal expression. One can peel away layers and go deeper and deeper, with no restrictions.')}</li>
					<li>${_('Reflecting: Sugar uses &quot;Journal&quot; to record each learner&rsquo;s activity. The Journal serves as a place for reflection and assessment of progress.')}</li>
					<li>${_('Sharing: The Sugar interface always shows the presence of other learners. Collaboration is a first-order experience. Students and teachers dialog with each other, support each other, critique each other, and share ideas.')}</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>${_('The Sugar Labs Community')}</h4>
				<p>${_('Three principles define the Sugar Labs community:')}</p>
				<ul>
					<li>${_('Everyone is a teacher and a learner.')}</li>
					<li>${_('Humans by their nature are social beings.')}</li>
					<li>${_('Humans by their nature are expressive.')}</li>

				<h3>${_('Join us!')}</h3>
				<p>${_('If these ideas excite you, we invite you to join our community of contributors and help us bring the Sugar Learning Platform to chlidren around the world. No prior experience with computers or educational technology is required - in fact, we actively encourage a diversity of backgrounds, ages, and perspectives since our ultimate goal is to make the Sugar experience deployable by classroom teachers and supportable by older students and the local community. We need packagers, testers, developers, curriculum designers, local deployers, and more.
