Originally developed for the &lt;a href="http://laptop.org"&gt;One Laptop Per Child Project&lt;/a&gt; and designed specifically as a 1-to-1 computing environment for K-8 students to collaborate with others in exploring the world around them, Sugar is used every day by over one and a half million students in classrooms throughout the world. It is now deployable for the cost of a stick rather than a laptop; students can take their Sugar on a Stick thumbdrive to any machine - at school, at home, at a library or community center - and boot their customized computing environment without touching the host machine&rsquo;s hard disk or existing system at all.'))}</p>
