Introduction:
fedora-web contains the build script, templates, and static files used to
build Fedora's website.  The build script, build/build.py generates static
website pages by walking through the input directory processing templates
with Genshi (http://genshi.edgewall.org/)

Requirements: python-genshi

Usage: Run make in this directory to build the website in all available
       languages.  To build a specific language, use make LANG, where LANG
       is the two-letter abbreviation for the translation.  A list of available
       translations is available in the header of the Makefile.  

       See build/build.py --help for more descriptions of specific options.

Editing/creating pages:
For general information about Genshi templates, see:
http://genshi.edgewall.org/wiki/Documentation, and in particular,
http://genshi.edgewall.org/wiki/Documentation/xml-templates.html

Currently, two variables are made available to all templates:
lang - The language code for the page
path - The base path for the site (eg. /, or http://fedoraproject.org/)

Adding languages:
To add a language, place the PO file in the po/ directory, and add the
language to LANGUAGES in the Makefile.
