	  void. In the event of a dispute, an Entry will be deemed to 
	  have been submitted by the owner of the email account entered 
	  on the registration form at the time of entry. For these 
	  purposes, an email account holder shall mean the natural 
	  person assigned to such email account by the Internet access 
	  provider, online service provider or other organization 
	  responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain 
	  associated with such email account. Any questions regarding 
	  the number of Entries submitted or the owner of an email 
	  account shall be determined by Sponsor, in its sole 
	  discretion, and Sponsor reserves the right to disqualify any 
	  Entries by persons determined to be tampering with or abusing 
	  any aspect of the Promotion. Normal Internet, phone and usage 
	  charges imposed by your online or phone service may apply. 
	  Sponsor reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to 
	  disqualify any Entry not in compliance with these Official 
	  Rules.</p>
	  </li>
	  <li><strong>Selection of Winner</strong>.  On or about August 
	  16, 2012, Sponsor will conduct three (3) random drawings 
	  (collectively referred to as “the Drawings”) to select up to 
	  a total of 220 potential winners.
	    <ul>
	      <li>First Round Drawing – The first random drawing 
	      (“First Drawing”) will be to select up to 50 potential 
	      winners from the pool of eligible Entries received by 
	      Sponsor. The pool of eligible Entries for the First 
	      Drawing will consist of Entries received from Participants
	       who selected the OLPC XO-1.75 laptop computer.</li>
	       <li>Second Round Drawing - The second random drawing 
	       (“Second Drawing”) will be to select 150 potential 
	       winners from the pool of eligible Entries received by 
	       Sponsor. The pool of eligible Entries for the Second 
	       Drawing will consist of Entries received from 
	       Participants who selected the Raspberry Pi.</li>
	       <li>Third Round Drawing - The third random drawing 
	       (“Third Drawing”) will be to select 20 potential winners
	        from the pool of eligible Entries received by Sponsor. 
		The pool of eligible Entries for the Third Drawing will 
		consist of Entries received from Participants who 
		selected the Arduino Uno R3 (Atmega328—assembled) with 
		matching “shield”.</li>

	    <p>The potential winners will be notified by email on or 
	    about August 16, 2012 using contact information provided by
	     the Participant in his or her Entry. If a potential winner 
	     does not respond within seven (7) days after the first 
	     attempt to contact him/her, or if the prize notification 
	     is returned as undeliverable, that potential winner will 
	     be deemed to have forfeited the prize, and Sponsor will 
	     select an alternate potential winner in his/her place at 
	     random from all remaining eligible Entries until all 
	     Prizes have been awarded. Winning a prize is contingent 
	     upon fulfilling all requirements set forth in these 
	     Official Rules. Noncompliance with the foregoing, failure 
	     to abide by these Official Rules, or return of the prize 
	     notification as non-deliverable may result in 
	     disqualification and naming of an alternate potential 
	     winner.</p>
	  </li>
	  <li><strong>Prizes and Odds</strong>. The Participants whose 
	  Entries are drawn at random in the First Drawing will each 
	  receive one OLPC XO-1.75 laptop computer (“First Drawing 
	  Prize”) with an Approximate Retail Value ("ARV") of $299 USD. 
	  The Participants whose Entries are drawn at random in the 
	  Second Drawing will each receive one Raspberry Pi (“Second 
	  Drawing Prize”) with an ARV of $50 USD. The Participants whose
	   Entries are drawn at random in the Third Drawing will each 
	  receive one Arduino Uno R3 (Atmega328—assembled) with 
	  matching “shield” (“Third Drawing Prize”) with an ARV of $85 
	  USD. The maximum total ARV of all prizes awarded is 24150 USD; 
	  however, the total ARV may be less if all Prizes are not 
	  awarded. If fewer than 50 Entries are received for the First
	  Drawing, then fewer than 50 First Drawing Prizes will be 
	  awarded. If fewer than 150 Entries are received for the 
	  Second Drawing, then fewer than 150 Second Drawing Prizes 
	  will be awarded. If fewer than 20 Entries are received for 
	  the Third Drawing, then fewer than 20 Third Drawing Prizes 
	  will be awarded.
	    <p>Prizes are subject to availability and Sponsor reserves
	    the right to substitute a prize of equal or greater value.
	    Odds of winning depend on the number of eligible Entries 
	    received. Prizes may not be redeemed for cash value and 
	    may not be transferred or assigned, except by Sponsor. 
	    Prizes consist of only those items specifically listed in
	    Paragraph 4 above ("Prizes and Odds"). Prizes will be 
	    delivered to Winners via standard postal mail 
	    approximately six (6) to ten (10) weeks after the close 
	    of Promotional Period. Sponsor will not replace any lost
	    or stolen prizes. Each prize is awarded without 
	    warranty of any kind from Sponsor, express or implied, 
	    without limitation, except where this would be contrary
	    to federal, state, provincial, or local laws or 
	    regulations. Expenses not specifically stated above, 
	    together with the reporting and payment of all 
	    applicable taxes, fees, duties, and/or surcharges, if

	    use of the prize, are the sole responsibility of the 
	    Winner. Restrictions, conditions, and limitations apply.</p>

	    this Promotion are registered or unregistered trademarks of 
	    their owners, who are not affiliated with nor have endorsed 
	    this Promotion. Prizes awarded under this Promotion may be 
	    subject to restrictions and licenses from their

	  Promotion as solely determined by Sponsor.
	    <p>Winners may be asked to participate in publicity. Except
