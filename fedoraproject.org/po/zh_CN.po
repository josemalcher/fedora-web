Need to see when the next pass of the satellites you like to talk on will occur?  Gpredict is already there for you. Probably the most popular of the software that is available are the ones that allow radio remote control and digital modes.

So I was exposed to several RPM-based distributions as well as Debian at the beginning. but to cut a long story short, starting around the time of Red Hat 7.x I was mostly on Red Hat; at some point I started doing backports of certain packages from the Fedora Rawhide tree - Evolution, and a couple of others - and that was around the time Warren Togami was starting his Fedora Project, and we talked a couple of times about it. and then it became Fedora Extras, and then the Core/Extras split was removed.
