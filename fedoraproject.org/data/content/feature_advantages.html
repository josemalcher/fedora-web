                <h2>Feature: Advantages</h2>
                <p>Fedora is a community sponsored project. Some of the things that sets Fedora apart from other distributions is in the bloodlines. Fedora is upstream for Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Red Hat is the main sponsor of the Fedora Project. Fedora is a general purpose system that gives Red Hat and the rest of its contributor community the chance to innovate rapidly with new technologies. Compared to distribution like Debian the release cycle is very rapid. Ubuntu is not a upstream project for its parent company. The technologies are not on the cutting edge as compared to Fedora. Good example would be the use Btrfs since Fedora 11. When we compare Fedora to Windows and OS X, Fedora is open source while these two competitors are not. I hope you can see the advantages of using Fedora and the benefit it can have for you in the enterprise environment.</p>
