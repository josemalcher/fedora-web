		<p>Fedora is a <strong>Linux-based <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system">operating system</a></strong>, a suite of software that makes your computer run. You can use the Fedora operating system to replace or to run alongside of other operating systems such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows">Microsoft Windows (TM)</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Os_x">Mac OS X (TM)</a>. The Fedora operating system is 100% free of cost for you to enjoy and share.</p>

		<p>Fedora is also <strong>partnership of free software community members</strong> from around the globe referred to as <strong>the Fedora Project</strong>. The Fedora Project builds open source software communities and produces a Linux distribution called "Fedora." This began in late 2003, when Red Hat Linux was discontinued. The Fedora Project is sponsored by <strong><a href="http://redhat.com">Red Hat</a></strong>, which invests in our infrastructure and resources to encourage collaboration and incubate innovative new technologies. Some of these technologies may later be integrated into <a href="http://redhat.com/http://www.redhat.com/products/">Red Hat products</a>. They are developed in Fedora and produced under a free and open source license from inception, so other free software communities and projects are free to study, adopt, and modify them.</p>
		
		<a name="why"><h3>Why is Fedora important?</h3></a>
		<p>The Fedora Project's mission is to lead the advancement of free and open source software and content as a collaborative community. The three elements of this mission are clear:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Fedora Project always strives to lead, not follow.</li>
			<li>The Fedora Project consistently seeks to create, improve, and spread free/libre code and content.</li>
			<li>The Fedora Project succeeds through shared action on the part of many people throughout our community. </li>
		</ul>
	
		<p>We strongly believe in the bedrock principles that created all the components of our operating system, and because of this we guarantee that Fedora will always be free for everyone, everywhere, to use, modify and distribute.</p>

		<a name="different"><h3>What makes Fedora different?</h3></a>
		<p>We try to always do the right thing, and provide only free and open source software. We will fight to protect and promote solutions that anyone can use and redistribute. To this end, we use only free and open source software to power the Fedora infrastructure itself. With this in mind, all of our developers are focused on working closely with  upstream  development teams, so everyone can benefit from our work and get access to our changes as soon as possible. Due to the huge amount of  innovation  that Fedora drives, this focus has had significant and long lasting effects. Some of the recent developments in free and open source software that Fedora has driven include: </p>
	
		<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/NetworkManager/">NetworkManager</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus">D-Bus</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://hal.freedesktop.org/docs/PolicyKit/">PolicyKit</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://packagekit.org/">PackageKit</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeviceKit">ConsoleKit</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeviceKit">DeviceKit</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://freeipa.org/">FreeIPA</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SELinux">SELinux</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://www.pulseaudio.org/">PulseAudio</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd">SystemD</a></li>
		</ul>

		<p>The reverse is also true: by sticking close to upstream development teams, Fedora often gets the latest software before anyone else. Not only does this benefit our community, but it also benefits the upstream teams by providing a much larger audience and more feedback for them.</p>

		<p>Another striking difference of Fedora is our goal to empower others to pursue their vision of what a free operating system should be. Fedora now forms the basis for <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/DerivedDistributions">derivative distributions</a> such as <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/RHEL">Red Hat Enterprise Linux</a>, the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/OLPC">One Laptop Per Child XO</a>, and Creative Commons' <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/LiveContent">Live Content DVDs</a>.</p>

		<p>And that's not all. It is just as easy for individuals to create their own distribution, thanks to Fedora's easy <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/CustomSpins">remixing tools</a>. These tools allow you to quickly select the packages you want, and create live images for CD/DVD or USB, or installation discs. Some official versions, or what we call "spins," of Fedora have grown up this way, including:</p>

		<ul>
		<li><a href="http://spins.fedoraproject.org/fel">Fedora Electronic Lab</a> (installable Live DVD)</li>
		<li><a href="http://spins.fedoraproject.org/xfce">Fedora Xfce Spin</a> (installable Live CD)</li>
		<li><a href="http://spins.fedoraproject.org/games">Fedora Games Spin</a> (installable Live DVD)</li>
		<li><a href="http://spins.fedoraproject.org/design">Fedora Design Spin</a> (installable Live DVD)</li>
		</ul>

		<p>We believe <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Software_Patents">software patents</a> are harmful, a hindrance to <a href="http://www.redhat.com/stories/liberatinginnovation/">innovation</a> in software development, and are inconsistent with the values of free and open source software. While tightly integrating proprietary and patent encumbered components might superficially improve ease of use, this practice does not benefit the community in the long run. The Fedora community prefers approaches that benefit the progress of free software in the future over those that emphasize short term ease of use. </p>

		<a name="values"><h3>What are Fedora's values?</h3></a>

		<h4>Our Four Foundations</h4>
		<p>The four foundations of freedom, features, friends, and first are the core values of the Fedora community. Read more about them below.</p>

		<a name="freedom"><h5>Freedom</h5></a>
		<p><strong>Freedom</strong> represents dedication to free software and content. We believe that advancing software and content freedom is a central goal for <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_Project">the Fedora Project</a>, and that we should accomplish that goal through the use of the software and content we promote. By including free alternatives to proprietary code and content, we can improve the overall state of free and open source software and content, and limit the effects of <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Forbidden_items">proprietary or patent encumbered code</a> on the Project. Sometimes this goal prevents us from taking the easy way out by including proprietary or patent encumbered software in Fedora, or using those kinds of products in our other project work. But by concentrating on the free software and content we provide and promote, the end result is that we are able to provide: releases that are predictable and 100% legally redistributable for everyone; innovation in free and open source software that can equal or exceed closed source or proprietary solutions; and, a completely free project that anyone can emulate or copy in whole or in part for their own purposes.</p>

		<a name="friends"><h5>Friends</h5></a>
		<p><strong>Friends</strong> represents the strength of our community. The Fedora community is made up of people from all walks of life, working together to advance free software. <a href="http://join.fedoraproject.org/">There is a place in Fedora for anyone who wants to help</a>, regardless of technical skill level, as long as they believe in our core values. Like any friends, we occasionally disagree on details, but we believe in finding an acceptable consensus to serve the interests of advancing free software. We believe in a strong partnership between Red Hat and our enormous volunteer community, since they both provide essential contributions that help the Fedora Project succeed.</p>

		<a name="features"><h5>Features</h5></a>
		<p><strong>Features</strong> represents our commitment to excellence. The Fedora community creates many of the technical features that have made Linux powerful, flexible, and usable for a wide spectrum of <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Statistics">millions</a> of users, administrators, and developers worldwide. We recognize the status quo is worth changing when the potential gain is to empower additional end-users, or create a more flexible and powerful environment for building new solutions on the free software we provide. We also believe that these changes are best developed in direct concert with the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Staying_close_to_upstream_projects">upstream software communities</a> whose work is part of the Fedora distribution. We work with the upstream in cases where we find opportunities for improvement, so all free software users benefit -- regardless of their distribution of choice. Our feature development is always done openly and transparently, and anyone may participate. </p>

		<a name="first"><h5>First</h5></a>
		<p><strong>First</strong> represents our commitment to innovation. We are not content to let others do all the heavy lifting on our behalf; we provide the latest in stable and robust, useful, and powerful free software in our Fedora distribution. An examination of the latest Fedora platform at any point in time shows the future direction of the operating system as it is experienced by everyone from the home desktop user to the enterprise business customer. Our <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases">rapid release cycle</a> is a major enabling factor in our ability to innovate. We recognize that there is also a place for long-term stability in the Linux ecosystem, and that there are a variety of community-oriented and business-oriented Linux distributions available to serve that need. However, the Fedora Project's goal of advancing free software dictates that the Fedora Project itself pursue a strategy that preserves the forward momentum of our technical, collateral, and community-building progress. Fedora always aims to provide the future, first. </p>
