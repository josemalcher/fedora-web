                <h3>What is the Fedora Project?</h3>
                <p>The Fedora Project was created in late 2003, when Red Hat Linux was discontinued. It is a global partnership of free software community members. The Fedora Project is sponsored by Red Hat, which invests in our infrastructure and resources to encourage collaboration and incubate innovative new technologies. Some of these technologies may later be integrated into Red Hat products. They are developed in Fedora and produced under a free and open source license from inception, so other free software communities and projects are free to study, adopt, and modify them.</p>
                <p>One of Fedora's main objectives is not only to contain software distributed under a free and open source license, but also to be on the leading edge of such technologies. Fedora developers prefer to make upstream changes instead of applying fixes specifically for Fedoraâ€”this ensures that their updates are available to all Linux distributions.</p>
