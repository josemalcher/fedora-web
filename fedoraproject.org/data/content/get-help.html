    <h2>${Markup(_('Get Help.'))}</h2>
	<p>${Markup(_('Being new to Fedora can seem daunting, fortunately there are lots of resources available to help make the transition easy. This page ties together all of the resources a new user might like to make use of, some of which would not be immediately obvious coming from another operating system.'))}</p>

	<p>${Markup(_('For those who already know about the different methods of getting support, but would like to know about Fedora specific locations, here they are:'))}</p>

	<ul>
		<li>${Markup(_('IRC: #fedora on irc.freenode.org'))}</li>
		<li>${Markup(_('Mailing List: &lt;a href="http://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/fedora-list"&gt;Fedora-list&lt;/a&gt;'))}</li>

	<h3>${Markup(_('Real Time Support (IRC)'))}</h3>

	<p>${Markup(_('If a problem requires real time support, with somebody to explain each step and deal with any problems as they arise, Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is the ideal solution. Fedora has a number of IRC channels, and one specifically aimed at end-user support.'))}</p>

	<p>${Markup(_('To access this support launch Fedoras default instant messaging client, Pidgin, and choose Manage from the Accounts menu. Add a new account, and select IRC as the protocol. Next, enter a Screen Name and save the changes. The final step is to add the #fedora channel by selecting Add Chat from the Buddies menu. Make sure to select an IRC account from the drop down menu, and enter #fedora as the channel, clicking Add to save the changes. Now that this is done, #fedora should appear in the default Pidgin screen, and double clicking this will allow you to access the #fedora channel, where end-users can ask questions and get support in real time.'))}</p>

	<h3>${Markup(_('e-mail Support'))}</h3>

	<p>${Markup(_('Some users prefer to take advantage of mailing lists to get help. The advantage of this method is that by subscribing to a mailing list it is possible to discover common problems many users have, and their solutions, before even encountering them! It also makes it easy to see when someone else needs help, and if you know the answer, to help them.'))}</p>

	<p>${Markup(_('The mailing list for end-user support with Fedora is &lt;a href="http://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/fedora-list"&gt;fedora-list&lt;/a&gt; and can be subscribed to by following that link.'))}</p>

	<h3>${Markup(_('Forum Support'))}</h3>

	<p>$Markup(_('A forum works in a similar manner to a mailing list, but instead of having messages sent to an e-mail address, they are posted to a website that anybody can read. Fedora has officially endorsed the community run &lt;a href="http://fedoraforum.org/"&gt;Fedora Forum&lt;/a&gt;, and it is an excellent resource for any questions about Fedora.'))}</p>

	<h3>${Markup(_('Written Documentation'))}</h3>

	<p>${Markup(_('Fedora also has a team of talented writers who work hard to produce excellent written documentation. There are a number of different documents available, including the Fedora User Guide, aimed at basic day to day operation of Fedora and the Fedora Admin Guide, aimed at explaining how to look after and maintain Fedora.'))}</p>

	<p>${Markup(_('These guides are available at &lt;a href=http://docs.fedoraproject.org"&gt;docs.fedoraproject.org&lt;/a&gt;.'))}</p>
