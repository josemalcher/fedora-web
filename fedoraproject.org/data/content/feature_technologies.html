                <h2>Feature: Technologies</h2>
                <p>Some excting technologies and features are available in Fedora. For example one of the newest filesystems being currently developed and still experimental is btrfs. Which has been available since Fedora 11 as an Installation option. This filesystem includes technology like snapshots. Basically its a way to do a SystemRollback if there is problem with the system. You can basically boot to a known working snapshot.</p>
                <p>Next we have the System Security Services Daemon SSSD provides expanded features for logging into managed domains, including caching for offline authentication. This means that, for example, users on laptops can still login when disconnected from the company's managed network. The authentication configuration tool in Fedora has been updated to support SSSD and redesigned to make it simpler to use.SSSD lets users who normally login to managed domains or networks do so even when offline.</p>
                <p>A new feature are for system administrators is the (BFO) boot.fedoraproject.org is a unique feature in Fedora. It allows users to download a single, tiny image and install current and future versions of Fedora without having to download additional images. Other functionality can be added incrementally while keeping the download extremely small, to enable more extensive installation and testing options. More information can be found at the BFO home page and at the original boot.kernel.org page.</p>
		<p>Color management helps artists, photographers, designers, and others display and print work more accurately using 100% free software. Color management supports setting output gamma tables for most monitors, including when they are hotplugged during a session. Users can also install vendor-supplied ICC or ICM files by double-clicking them, and calibrate displays and scanners with external devices and color targets using the ArgyllCMS package. Written by Richard Hughes, Red Hat engineer and Fedora contributor.</p>
		<p>These are some the new technologies that are available now in Fedora. In the future Fedora plans to bring new features such as D programming language compiler, there will be release available for the Amazon EC2 cloud, GNUstep development environment, Meego will have user experience avaiable in the upcoming release. Stay tuned for new features coming to the Fedora Project.</p>
