From time to time we are asked to comment on laws or pending legislation. As a project with contributors and users from most counties in the world, The Fedora Project generally avoids taking sides on matters of governments, political parties or interests. Instead of trying to take a stance on each particular law or proposed law in each of the countries in which we have participants, the Fedora Project reaffirms its principle belief in Internet freedoms.'))}</p>

Fedora also encourages individuals within the project to stand up for freedoms in a responsible manner, when they feel it is appropriate to do so."))}</p>
