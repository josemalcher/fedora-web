        <p>If you do not find the answer to your question in the
        published guidelines, please consult your legal counsel for
        advice.  Red Hat will not review requests for permission to use
        trademarks or for guidance pertaining to the use of its

        relationship.  Therefore, Red Hat will not respond to requests
        to review such matters, including but not limited to product
        packaging, advertising, domain names, marketing materials or
        other collateral.  If you have a request that is not addressed
        here, please consult your legal counsel.</p>

        <p>Without waiving any of its rights, Red Hat does not advise
        others on the scope of its intellectual property rights.  Red
        Hat does not permit or consent to any use of its trademarks in
        any manner that is likely to cause confusion by implying
        association with or sponsorship by Red Hat.  If you are aware of
        any such use, please contact us at <em>trademarks at redhat dot
          com</em>.  Consult your legal counsel if you have questions.</p>
