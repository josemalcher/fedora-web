        <h2>Fedora Trademark Guidelines</h2>
        <h3>&quot;Fair Use&quot; of Trademarks</h3>

        <p>Although a trademark owner should take action to police the
        use of its trademarks by others, it cannot prevent others from
        using its trademarks under all circumstances. For instance, a
        company may refer to the trademarks of competing products in
        marketing its own products. As an example, Burger King might
        choose to state in advertisements that &#8220;Burger King&reg;
        french fries were preferred over McDonald&#8217;s&reg; french fries
        in a taste test.&#8221; Although McDonald&#8217;s&reg; is a trademark of
        McDonald&#8217;s Corporation, Burger King could mention it in its
        marketing in this fashion so long as the statement is truthful
        and not misleading, does not imply an improper association
        with or sponsorship by McDonald&#8217;s and otherwise complies with
        applicable laws. A key element in evaluating whether the use
        of someone else&#8217;s trademark is acceptable is whether the use
        is likely to cause confusion in the marketplace as to the
        source or sponsorship of a product. Burger King&#8217;s use of
        &#8221;McDonald&#8217;s&reg;&#8221; in the statement above is not likely to lead
        consumers to believe that Burger King&reg; french fries are a
        product of McDonald&#8217;s or that Burger King&reg; french fries
        emanate from or are sponsored or approved by McDonald&#8217;s
        Corporation.</p>
