        <h2>Fedora Trademark Guidelines</h2> 

        <h3>Use of the Fedora Mark and Other Red Hat Trademarks Which
          Are Included in Fedora</h3>

        <p>One of the purposes of the Fedora Project is to make a
        cutting-edge version of Linux&reg; widely available in a
        consistent format that the public can come to trust. In order
        to achieve this purpose it is important that the technology
        can quickly be identified and that the recipient knows the
        technology they are receiving is the official and unmodified
        version. Red Hat has chosen the Fedora&trade; mark to identify
        this effort and is granting broad usage rights in that
        trademark in order to assure widespread availability.</p>

        <p>Companies, governments, schools or individuals who wish to
        produce CD-ROM and other products that contain the software
        which the Fedora Project distributes under the Fedora&trade;
        may do so as long as they follow these guidelines. Except as
        expressly granted herein or under rights of fair use, no party
        has a right to use the Fedora&trade; mark in association with
        the software provided by the Fedora Project. Doing so would
        cause confusion among the customers who obtain those products,
        because they may believe they are obtaining a product
        emanating from or sponsored by the Fedora Project but, in
        reality, it is a product of another company altogether.</p>

        <p>To address this issue, we have developed the following
        guidelines for the use of the Fedora&trade; trademark and such
        other Red Hat marks as are included in Fedora&trade;. These
        guidelines are designed to serve both consumers of Linux-based
        products, to ensure that they know the source of the products
        they purchase, and publishers of Linux-based products, so that
        they can avoid improperly generating confusion in the
        marketplace.</p>

        <h2>Use of the Brand &#8220;Fedora&#8221;</h2> 

        <p>Fedora&trade; is a trademark of Red Hat, Inc. and may only be
        used with Red Hat Inc.&#8217;s express permission. Except as
        provided herein, you may not use &#8220;Fedora&#8221; or any confusingly
        similar mark as a trademark for your product, or use &#8220;Fedora&#8221;
        in any other manner that might cause confusion in the
        marketplace, including in advertising, on auction sites, or on
        software or hardware. Any party wishing to use the
        Fedora&trade; mark may do so as long as they meet two
        conditions:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>They must only use the Fedora&trade; mark in association
          with the original Fedora&trade; code found on the Fedora
          Project website (see <a
            href="http://fedoraproject.org">http://fedoraproject.org</a>)
          without modification; and</li>

          <li>If they charge a fee for the CD-ROM or other media on
          which they deliver the Fedora&trade; code, they warranty the
          media on which the Fedora&trade; code is delivered, thus
          ensuring that the recipient receives a usable copy.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This same permission applies to such other Red Hat trademarks
        as are included in the authorized Fedora&trade; distribution,
        such as RPM&trade;. Except as expressly stated herein, no
        other rights are granted to use any other Red Hat trademarks,
        specifically including the RED HAT&reg; and &#8220;Shadowman&#8221;
        logo&reg; marks. <em>Absolutely no exceptions</em>.</p>
