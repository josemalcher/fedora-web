        <h2>Fedora Trademark Guidelines</h2>
        <h3>Basic Introduction</h3>

        <p>Trademarks are used to identify the source of goods and
        services in the market. Trademark law is best understood as
        consumer protection law, since it enables consumers of
        products to know the source of the products they purchase and
        allows them to distinguish those products from the products of
        other vendors. This is important in order to ensure that
        consumers are not fooled into purchasing a product of one
        company while believing it is a product of another
        company.</p>

        <p>For instance, Heinz&reg; ketchup is a well-known brand of
        ketchup. If Jones Company decided to make its own ketchup, and
        was able to market it as Heinz&reg; ketchup, Jones Company
        would profit in the sale of its ketchup from the customer
        goodwill established by the owner of the well-known Heinz&reg;
        brand. Although that might be good for Jones Company, it could
        be bad for the consumers who purchased the Jones Company
        ketchup, believing that it was Heinz&reg; ketchup. Such
        trademark use would be impermissible under applicable
        law. This is true even though the Jones Company ketchup
        contains exactly the same ingredients as the Heinz&reg;
        ketchup.</p>

        <p>A similar situation arises with the trademarks owned by Red
        Hat. Many consumers have come to trust the Red Hat&reg;
        branded products and services, and look for a Red Hat brand,
        including Fedora&trade; when they obtain our
        open source products. As a result, consumers who obtain
        products that are labeled Fedora&trade; or some
        close variation (see "Use of Fedora
        Trademark") believe that they are the official products of the
        Fedora Project. Consumers often expect that such
        products will contain features that are available only from
        the Fedora Project. In order to protect consumers,
        Red Hat has an obligation to ensure that its trademarks are
        not used to identify the products of other companies or used
        in any other manner which states or implies an association or
        sponsorship by Red Hat of other companies' products.</p>
