        <h2>Fedora Trademark Guidelines</h2>
        <h3>Protection of Trademarks</h3>

        <p>Under trademark law, owners of trademarks who use their
        trademarks improperly or who fail to police the use of their
        trademarks by others may lose their rights in those
        trademarks. For instance, now-common words such as "zipper"
        and "elevator" were trademarks at one time. Their owners
        allowed the marks to be widely known and used as generic names
        for the associated products, and, as a result, all trademark
        protection was lost. Some examples of trademarks that are
        protected by their owners at great lengths today from such
        "genericide" include Kleenex&reg; brand facial tissues,
        Band-Aid&reg; brand bandages and Xerox&reg; brand
        photocopiers. In addition to monitoring the use of trademarks
        by others, policing also requires maintaining control over the
        nature and quality of the goods and services that are marketed
        under the trademarks.</p>

        <p>Red Hat has filed to register the trademark Fedora&trade; in
        the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We are also
        seeking registration of the mark in many other countries
        around the world, have filed applications to register the mark
        in still other countries, and we will continue to aggressively
        register our trademarks in countries where we do business.</p>

        <p>Our unregistered trademarks are also protected under
        trademark law. Unregistered trademarks of Red Hat include,
        RPM&trade; and Bluecurve&trade;.</p>
