        <p>RED HAT, INC. RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CHANGE THESE GUIDELINES
        AT ANY TIME. YOU SHOULD PERIODICALLY CHECK THESE GUIDELINES TO
        BE SURE THAT YOU ARE IN COMPLIANCE.</p>

        <p>Red Hat, Inc. has a long and distinguished history of being
        an active contributor to the open source software
        community. One of the key features of open source software is
        that anyone has the right to copy, modify and redistribute the
        software, subject to the terms and conditions of certain
        license agreements or copyright permissions, such as the GNU
        General Public License. It is important to understand that,
        although Red Hat allows third parties to replicate its open
        source software under the GNU GPL, absent a written agreement
        or other express permission it does not allow third parties to
        use its trademarks. For example, absent a trademark license
        from Red Hat,a party would have the right to copy, modify and
        sell Red Hat&#8217;s open source software, but they would have to
        call it by another name. Red Hat has always been fully
        supportive of open source rights with regard to copyrights and
        demonstrates that support by releasing the software we develop
        under open source licenses. This document is designed to
        provide guidance on how the software developed and marketed
        under The fedora Project may be marketed by
        others, using Red Hat&#8217;s Fedora&trade;.</p>

        <h3>A Brief Introduction To Copyright And Trademark Law As They
          Relate To Software</h3>

        <p>The guidelines in this document are based on United States
        law. Although many countries follow the same principles
        discussed below, the laws of other countries may also differ on
        some points.</p>

        <h3>Copyright</h3>

        <p>Copyright law protects the expression of an idea.
        Fedora&trade; consists of hundreds of software modules, some
        developed by Red Hat and many developed by other members of the
        open source community. Those authors hold the copyrights in the
        modules or code they developed. At the same time, the combined
        body of work that constitutes Fedora&trade; is a collective work
        which has been organized by the Fedora&trade; Project, and the
        Fedora Project holds the copyright in that collective work.
        Fedora Project then permits others to copy, modify and
        redistribute the collective work. To grant this permission the
        Fedora Project usually uses the GNU General Public License
        ("GPL") version 2 and the Fedora Project&#8217;s own End User License
        Agreement. Although software licensed under the GPL is "open
        source software," the Fedora Project retains ownership of the
        copyright in its collective work. If someone violates the GPL
        regarding that collective work, only the Fedora Project, as the
        copyright owner and licensor of that collective work, has legal
        authority to enforce the GPL against the violator. Although the
        Fedora Project "owns" the collective work, in licensing it under
        the GPL, the Fedora Project grants broad rights in the
        collective work to others. Neither the GPL nor the Fedora
        Project&#8217;s End User License Agreement grant any right to use Red
        Hat&#8217;s trademarks in the redistribution of the collective
        work.</p>
