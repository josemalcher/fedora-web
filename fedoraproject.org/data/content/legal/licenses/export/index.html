        <h2>Fedora Export Control Product Matrix</h2>

        <h3>EXPORT COMPLIANCE/CUSTOMS INFORMATION</h3>

        <p>
        The Fedora Product Matrix and the following information is not
        intended to replace the Export Administration Regulations
        ("EAR"), other U.S. Export laws, or the Harmonized Tariff
        Schedule ("HTS"), but is provided as an accommodation to our
        partners and customers to be used in conjunction with said
        laws to assist you in the export and import of Fedora
        products.  The exporter is responsible for exporting Fedora
        products, in accordance with the requirements of the EAR,
        other U.S. Export laws, and the HTS.  End-user, end-use and
        country of ultimate destination may affect export licensing
        requirements.  All Export Control Classification Numbers
        ("ECCN"), HTS Numbers and License Authorization information
        are subject to change without notice.  Modification in any way
        to a Fedora product voids the classification.  It is your
        obligation as an exporter to verify such information and
        comply with the current applicable regulations.  IF YOU EXPORT
        FEDORA PRODUCTS, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPLYING WITH THE
        REQUIREMENTS OF THE BUREAU OF INDUSTRY AND SECURITY ("BIS"),
        EAR, OR OTHER U.S. EXPORT LAWS.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>All Export information is provided "As-is".  Fedora makes
          no warranty or representation that the information contained
          on this site is accurate, current, or complete. It is your
          obligation as the exporter to comply with the current
          applicable requirements of United States export rules and
          regulations. Any use of such information by you is without
          recourse to Fedora and is at your own risk.  Fedora is in no
          way responsible for any damages whether direct,
          consequential, incidental, or otherwise, suffered by you as
          a result of using or relying upon such information for any
          purpose.</strong> </p>

        <h3>Embargoed Destinations</h3>

        <p>Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan or Syria.</p>

        <h3>Denied Persons/Entities Lists</h3>

        and/or technical data may NOT be exported/reexported, either
