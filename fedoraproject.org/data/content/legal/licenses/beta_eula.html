        <h2>LICENSE AGREEMENT FEDORA&trade; TEST RELEASE</h2>

        <p>This agreement governs the download, installation or use of
        the Software (as defined below) and any updates to the
        Software, regardless of the delivery mechanism. The Software
        is a collective work under U.S.  Copyright Law.  Subject to
        the following terms, Fedora Project grants to the user
        (&ldquo;User&rdquo;) a license to this collective work
        pursuant to the GNU General Public License.  By downloading,
        installing or using the Software, User agrees to the terms of
        this agreement.</p>

        <p><strong>1.  The Software.</strong> Fedora (the
        &ldquo;Software&rdquo;) is a modular Linux operating system
        consisting of hundreds of software components.  The end user
        license agreement for each component is located in the
        component&#8217;s source code.  With the exception of certain image
        files containing the Fedora trademark identified in Section 2
        below, the license terms for the components permit User to
        copy, modify, and redistribute the component, in both source
        code and binary code forms.  This agreement does not limit
        User&#8217;s rights under, or grant User rights that supersede, the
        license terms of any particular component. </p>

        <p><strong>2.  Intellectual Property Rights.</strong> The Software and
        each of its components, including the source code,
        documentation, appearance, structure and organization are
        copyrighted by Fedora Project and others and are protected
        under copyright and other laws.  Title to the Software and any
        component, or to any copy, modification, or merged portion
        shall remain with the aforementioned, subject to the
        applicable license.  The &ldquo;Fedora&rdquo; trademark is a
        trademark of Red Hat, Inc. (&ldquo;Red Hat&rdquo;) in the
        U.S. and other countries and is used by permission.  This
        agreement permits User to distribute unmodified copies of
        Software using the Fedora trademark on the condition that User
        follows Red Hat&#8217;s trademark guidelines located at <a
          href="http://fedoraproject.org/legal">http://fedoraproject.org/legal</a>.
        User must abide by these trademark guidelines when
        distributing the Software, regardless of whether the Software
        has been modified.  If User modifies the Software, then User
        must replace all images containing the &ldquo;Fedora&rdquo;
        trademark.  Those images are found in the anaconda-images and
        fedora-logos packages.  Merely deleting these files may
        corrupt the Software.</p>

        <p><strong>3.  Limited Warranty.</strong> Except as specifically stated in
        this agreement or a license for a particular component, <strong>to
          the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the
          Software and the components are provided and licensed
          &ldquo;as is&rdquo; without warranty of any kind, expressed or
          implied, including the implied warranties of merchantability,
          non-infringement or fitness for a particular purpose.</strong>
        Neither the Fedora Project nor Red Hat warrants that the
        functions contained in the Software will meet User&#8217;s
        requirements or that the operation of the Software will be
        entirely error free or appear precisely as described in the
        accompanying documentation. User acknowledges that this
        Software is not fully tested and that it, and any
        documentation, may contain defects, fail to comply with
        specifications, produce unintended or erroneous results.
        <strong>Use of the Software is at User&#8217;s own risk.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>4.  Limitation of Remedies and Liability. To the maximum
          extent permitted by applicable law, Fedora Project and Red Hat
          will not be liable to User for any damages, including
          incidental or consequential damages, lost profits or lost
          savings arising out of the use or inability to use the
          Software, even if Fedora Project or Red Hat has been advised
          of the possibility of such damages.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>5.  Export Control.</strong> As required by U.S. law, User
        represents and warrants that it: (a) understands that the
        Software is subject to export controls under the U.S. Commerce
        Department&rsquo;s Export Administration Regulations
        (&ldquo;EAR&rdquo;); (b) is not located in a prohibited
        destination country under the EAR or U.S. sanctions
        regulations (currently Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea,
        Sudan and Syria); (c) will not export, re-export, or transfer
        the Software to any prohibited destination, entity, or
        individual without the necessary export license(s) or
        authorizations(s) from the U.S.  Government; (d) will not use
        or transfer the Software for use in any sensitive nuclear,
        chemical or biological weapons, or missile technology end-uses
        unless authorized by the U.S. Government by regulation or
        specific license; (e) understands and agrees that if it is in
        the United States and exports or transfers the Software to
        eligible end users, it will, as required by EAR Section
        741.17(e), submit semi-annual reports to the Commerce
        Department&rsquo;s Bureau of Industry &amp; Security (BIS), which
        include the name and address (including country) of each
        transferee; and (f) understands that countries other than the
        United States may restrict the import, use, or export of
        encryption products and that it shall be solely responsible
        for compliance with any such import, use, or export
        restrictions.</p>

        <p><strong>6.  General.</strong> If any provision of this agreement is
        held to be unenforceable, that shall not affect the
        enforceability of the remaining provisions.  This agreement
        shall be governed by the laws of the State of North Carolina
        and of the United States, without regard to any conflict of
        laws provisions, except that the United Nations Convention on
        the International Sale of Goods shall not apply.</p>
