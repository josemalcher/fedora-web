	  <h3><a name="id2984207"></a>What is Fedora?</h3>
	  <p>
	  Fedora is a set of projects sponsored by Red Hat and guided by
	  contributors. These projects are developed by a large community
	  of people who strive to provide and maintain the very best in
	  free, open source software and standards. The center piece of
	  the Fedora project is an operating system (Fedora Collection)
	  that is released twice a year, and is based on the Linux kernel,
	  that is always free for anyone to use, modify, and distribute.
	</p><p>
	  Before each release, there are three development releases made
	  available, and each one has a different intended audience:
	</p><ul><li><p>The Alpha release is aimed at developers. It contains many bleeding-edge packages and is definitely not recommended for production machines.  </p></li><li><p>The Beta release is aimed at early adopters, and at this point in the development cycle most things should work and all new features should be in a testable form. Although still not recommended for production machines, by trying this release users can provide crucial feedback that will help ensure the final release is as good as possible. </p></li><li><p>The Preview release is for users and contributors in the free software community. This release signals the point when we need full participation from the community, with plenty of feedback, as only through lots of use will we find all those hard to spot bugs that need fixing before release. </p></li></ul><p>

          The Beta release represents a snapshot of Rawhide, the
          development branch of the Fedora Collection, and signals the
          feature freeze. This means that all major features must be
          complete or in a testable state, and so the Beta release
          provides a good indication of what users can expect from the
          final release. It is aimed primarily at developers and
          early-adopters, but less experienced users who are interested
          in helping with testing are encouraged to do so with the live
          media (bootable CDs, DVDs or USB sticks).
        </p><p></p><h4 class="title"><a name="id3000437"></a>How To Try Beta</h4><p>
          Thanks to the infrastructure that was developed during the
          Fedora 7 release cycle, this Beta release is accompanied by
          live media images (for CDs, DVDs or USB sticks) of the GNOME
          and KDE desktops. These live images make testing possible
          without installing any software on an existing system. As the
          Beta release is the time when we need plenty of input and
          testing from the community, this method is an extremely easy
          and effective way for anybody to get involved with testing the
          next Fedora release.
        </p><p>
          Beta images can be downloaded from any of our mirrors by
          visiting this
          <a class="ulink" href="http://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/publiclist/Fedora/9-Beta/" target="_top">page</a>.
          Remember that live images can be used on USB media via the
          'livecd-iso-to-disk' utility available in the livecd-tools
          package on existing Fedora systems; Refer to this
          <a class="ulink" href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FedoraLiveCD/LiveCDHowTo" target="_top"> page</a> for
          more instructions.
        </p><p></p><h4 class="title"><a name="id2986202"></a>Providing Feedback</h4><p>
          As mentioned above, the Beta release provides an opportunity
          for the wider community to begin testing the next release of
          Fedora. You can help the Fedora Project continue to improve
          Fedora if you file bug reports and enhancement requests. These
          links will explain what needs testing for the Beta release and
          allow you to submit your feedback:

          Development continues on Rawhide after the Beta release,
          ensuring that all the features that have made it this far and
          stable for the Release Candidate and final release. The links
          below provide the release schedule for both the pre-releases
          and the final release, as well as the wiki pages for the

	  As always, Fedora continues to
	  <a class="ulink" href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/RedHatContributions" target="_top">develop</a>
	  and integrate the latest free and open source software. The
	  following sections provide a brief overview of major changes
	  from the last release of Fedora. For more details about other
	  features that are making their way into Rawhide and set for
	  inclusion in Fedora 9, please see their individual
	  <a class="ulink" href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/9/FeatureList" target="_top">wiki
	    pages</a> which detail their goals and progress. Also,
	  throughout the release cycle there will be
	  <a class="ulink" href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Interviews" target="_top">interviews</a>
	  with the developers behind key features, so keep an eye on these
	  to get the inside scoop.
	</p><p></p><h4 class="title"><a name="id2993089"></a>Desktop</h4><p></p><h5 class="title"><a name="id3001061"></a>GNOME Desktop 2.22 Release</h5><p>
	  GNOME 2.22 brings many improvements, not least of which is
	  the introduction of GVFS and GIO as a replacement for GNOME
	  VFS by Fedora developer and nautilus maintainer
	  <a class="ulink" href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/AlexanderLarsson" target="_top">AlexanderLarsson</a>.
	  GVFS introduces many benefits including performance
	  improvements, queuing multiple file transfers, and security
	  enhancements via Policy<code class="code"></code>Kit, which is developed and
	  maintained by Fedora developer
	  <a class="ulink" href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/DavidZeuthen" target="_top">DavidZeuthen</a>, and
	  was first introduced in Fedora 8.
	</p><p>
	  GNOME 2.22 also comes with a new world clock applet that
	  displays the time and weather conditions for multiple time
	  zones simultaneously.
	</p><p>
	  <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/9/Beta/ReleaseNotes?action=AttachFile&amp;do=get&amp;target=clockapplet.png" alt="attachment:clockapplet.png"/></span>
	</p><p>
	  Also exciting on the GNOME front is the inclusion of the new
	  GNOME Display Manager by default. It is a significant change
	  from the previous GDM, enabling many new and exciting
	  features. These features include the ability to take
	  advantage of power management at the login screen, the
	  ability to dynamically configure displays, potential
	  improvements for "hot-seating," and better integration with
	  Policy<code class="code"></code>Kit.
	</p><p></p><h5 class="title"><a name="id2968427"></a>GNOME Application Improvements</h5><p></p><h6 class="title"><a name="id2982590"></a>Bluetooth</h6><p>
	  In GNOME, sharing files via Bluetooth has been better
	  integrated into the desktop, rather than relying on
	  several separate applications. Palm Pilots can also now be
	  synchronised using Bluetooth.
	</p><p></p><h6 class="title"><a name="id2979974"></a>Totem</h6><p>
	  Totem, among other improvements, now has
	  better text subtitles
	  support, a YouTube
	  search plugin, and a MythTV plugin.
	</p><p></p><h6 class="title"><a name="id2986433"></a>Rhythmbox</h6><p>
	  Rhythmbox is now the default CD player, and has UPNP
	  support as well as better Podcast support (Atom feeds and
	  iTunes podcasts).
	</p><p></p><h6 class="title"><a name="id2998845"></a>Sound recorder</h6><p>
	  A number of bugs have been fixed in the sound recorder,
	  making it solid enough to be included in Fedora 9.
	</p><p></p><h5 class="title"><a name="id2979823"></a>KDE Desktop 4.0.2</h5><p>
	  KDE Desktop 4.0.2 features upgrades to core components such
	  as the port to Qt 4. It also introduces a number of brand
	  new frameworks such as the Phonon, a multimedia API; Solid,
	  a hardware integration framework; Plasma, a re-written
	  desktop and panel with many new concepts; integrated desktop
	  search; compositing as a feature of KWin; and a brand new
	  visual style called Oxygen.
	</p><p>
	  Thanks to the hard work of the Fedora
	  <a class="ulink" href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/KDE" target="_top">KDE
            Special Interest Group</a>, KDE 4.0 is well integrated
	  in Fedora. As a result, KDE 4.0 is the default for the KDE
	  spin of Fedora, and includes compatibility packages to
	  ensure that applications not yet ported to KDE 4 will
	  continue to work.

	</p><p></p><h5 class="title"><a name="id2999782"></a>NetworkManager Improvements</h5><p>
	  Network<code class="code"></code>Manager has made managing your network devices
	  easy in Fedora. With this release, our developers are aiming
	  to expand the situations in which Network<code class="code"></code>Manager is
	  useful. New features available in the Beta release include:
	</p><ul type="disc"><li><p>Ad-hoc support, so that you can easily form a network with any near-by wireless devices </p></li><li><p>Support for mobile broadband cards (GSM/CDMA) through PPP </p></li><li><p>
	      System-wide network configuration through
	      Network<code class="code"></code>Manager with Policy<code class="code"></code>Kit
	    </p></li></ul><p></p><h5 class="title"><a name="id2986066"></a>Firefox 3 Beta 5 Browser</h5><p>
	  Firefox 3 Beta 5 brings a number of major improvements
	  including a native look and feel, desktop integration, the
	  new Places replacement for bookmarks, and a re-worked
	  address bar.
	</p><p>
	  <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/9/Beta/ReleaseNotes?action=AttachFile&amp;do=get&amp;target=firefox.png" alt="attachment:firefox.png"/></span>
	</p><p></p><h5 class="title"><a name="id2997155"></a>Flash Browser Plugin</h5><p>
	  Thanks to
	  <a class="ulink" href="http://swfdec.freedesktop.org/" target="_top">swfdec</a>
	  changing to a GStreamer backend, Fedora can now ship a free
	  software flash browser plugin available out of the box. It
	  is capable of playing many flash content including videos,
	  animation and games.
	  Note that Fedora only <a class="ulink" href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Objectives" target="_top">
            includes</a> patent unencumbered free software
	  components.
	</p><p></p><h5 class="title"><a name="id2977751"></a>Consolidated Dictionary Support</h5><p>
	  For some time, several Fedora applications, including
	  Open<code class="code"></code>Office.org, Firefox, Thunderbird, GNOME and KDE,
	  have each had their own set of dictionaries. This situation
	  was obviously not ideal, and unnecessarily increased
	  resources like the size and memory footprint of Fedora
	  releases. This problem is now fixed by consolidating all the
	  dictionaries. This feature, which requires a number of
	  changes to various software packages, is now almost complete
	  and the benefits are already apparent in the Beta release.
	</p><p>
	  More details and documentation can be found on the feature's
	  <a class="ulink" href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/FeatureDictionary" target="_top">wiki
            page</a>.
	</p><p></p><h4 class="title"><a name="id2990523"></a>System</h4><p></p><h5 class="title"><a name="id2982697"></a>Anaconda Installer Improvements</h5><p>
	  The Anaconda team is actively developing a number of new
	  features for Fedora 9. The Beta release includes the
	  following new features:
	</p><ul type="disc"><li><p>
	      The inclusion of the <code class="code">netinst.iso</code> as opposed
	      to the previous <code class="code">boot.iso</code>,
	      <code class="code">rescuecd.iso</code> and <code class="code">diskboot.img</code>.
	      The netinst.iso image contains the kernel, initrd and
	      image used for installation - everything the user needs
	      to install a system over the network.
	    </p></li><li><p>
	      Support for resizing ext2, ext3 and NTFS partitions.
	      Watch a
	      <a class="ulink" href="http://katzj.fedorapeople.org/resizing-demo1.ogg" target="_top">screencast</a>.
	    </p></li><li><p>Support for creating and installing to encrypted filesystems </p></li><li><p>Increased separation of the installer second stage and the packages being installed </p></li><li><p>Allow the user to set the install source during the second stage of installation </p></li><li><p>Use libblkid for filesystem probing </p></li><li><p>
	      Experimental support for installing to ext4 filesystems
	      if you install with <code class="code">iamanext4developer</code> as a
	      boot option
	    </p></li><li><p>Support for native installation to x86_64 machines using EFI and booting via grub </p></li><li><p>Completely overhauled hardware probing and detection based on udev and HAL rather than kudzu </p></li></ul><p></p><h5 class="title"><a name="id2986346"></a>Live Image Improvements</h5><p>
	  Work has continued to better integrate the live images with
	  the rest of the system and improve the tools used for
	  building them. livecd-creator now also provides an API which
	  can be used for building alternative front-ends as well as
	  for building tools for other types of images.
	</p><p>
	  The initial work to support persistent changes with a live
	  image have also landed. The primary usage of this feature is
	  booting a USB stick with your live image as well as the
	  persistent changes. To do this, take the live image and you
	  can run the following command:
	</p><ul type="disc"><li><p>
	      <code class="code">livecd-iso-to-disk --overlay-size-mb 512
                /path/to/iso /path/tousbstick</code>
	    </p></li></ul><p>
	  where 512 is the desired size (in megabytes) of the overlay.
	  You can find the livecd-iso-to-disk shell script in the
	  LiveOS directory at the top-level of the CD image. Note that
	  you'll need to have space on your USB stick for the live
	  image plus your overlay plus any other data you want on the
	  stick.
	</p><p></p><h5 class="title"><a name="id2985981"></a>Upstart Init Daemon</h5><p>
	  Fedora 9 uses the Upstart init daemon as a replacement for
	  System V init. The benefit of this is that Upstart has a
	  more sophisticated idea of how to to trigger and manage
	  services. For Fedora this is particularly useful as it will
	  help us to improve our boot and shutdown processes,
	  streamlining a lot of what currently happens.
	</p><p>
	  All current init scripts should run without errors. However,
	  any customizations to <code class="code">/etc/inittab</code> will need to
	  be ported to upstart. For information on how to do so,
	  please see the
	  <a class="ulink" href="http://upstart.ubuntu.com/getting-started.html" target="_top">Upstart
            Getting Started Guide</a>.
	</p><p>
	  There are some known issues with upstart at this point that
	  beta testers should be aware of, including:
	</p><ul type="disc"><li><p>
	      <a class="ulink" href="http://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=433156" target="_top">Details
                mode in RHGB</a> is not working
	    </p></li><li><p>Automatic serial console configuration is not working </p></li></ul><p>
	  For Fedora package maintainers, it is not recommended to
	  move System V init scripts to native Upstart events at this
	  time.
	</p><p></p><h5 class="title"><a name="id2992438"></a>FreeIPA</h5><p>
	  Free<code class="code"></code>IPA makes managing auditing, identity and policy
	  processes easier by providing web-based and command line
	  provisioning and administration tools that takes the pain
	  away from system administration. It combines the power of
	  the Fedora Directory Server with Free<code class="code"></code>RADIUS, MIT
	  Kerberos, NTP and DNS to provide an easy, out of the box
	  solution.
	</p><p></p><h5 class="title"><a name="id2976400"></a>PackageKit</h5><p>
	  Package<code class="code"></code>Kit is a cross-distribution package management
	  solution that has a complete yum backend. It has been
	  designed to make installing and updating software on your
	  computer easier, and aims to unify all the graphical package
	  management tools used in different distributions. To do
	  this, Package<code class="code"></code>Kit makes use of some of the latest
	  technologies such as Policy<code class="code"></code>Kit and D-Bus. It is the
	  default graphical package manager in the Beta release, using
	  the yum backend.

	</p><p></p><h5 class="title"><a name="id2985909"></a>Fast X</h5><p>
	  X takes too long to start up slowing down many aspects of
	  the system including boot, logout and fast user switching.
	  The goal of this project is to tune and make some
	  architectural changes to X so that it can go from exec to
	  ready to accept clients in one second. For a detailed list

	  releases, has some significant new features and
	  improvements. The information available here is a brief
	  summary, to find more information about these features visit
	  the
	  <a class="ulink" href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/9/FeatureList" target="_top">feature
            list</a>.

	  During the Fedora 8 release cycle, Fedora got a new Font
	  Special Interest Group. Working exclusively to ensure that
	  our packaged fonts meet with our own standards with respect
	  to free software, and cater to as many languages as
	  possible, they have been busy reviewing and packaging new
	  fonts for Fedora 9. There's much more work still to be done,
	  but below is a brief summary of what has been achieved so
	  far:
	</p><ul type="disc"><li><p>
	      DejaVu full replaces DejaVu LGC as default font set.
	      DejaVu LGC is still available in the repo for users who
	      prefer it.
	    </p></li><li><p>The Luxi font has been dropped since its license does not allow modifications. </p></li><li><p>
	      DejaVu and Liberation updated to new versions with more
	      coverage.
	    </p></li><li><p>The Stix, Tiresias, Yanonne, and Greek Font Society font sets, and several others, have been added to the Fedora software repository. </p></li><li><p>Many font packages were renamed and reorganized to avoid bundling font and regions. </p></li></ul><p></p><h5 class="title"><a name="id2994966"></a>ext4 Filesystem</h5><p>
	  The ext4 filesystem is the evolution of the mature and
	  stable ext3. ext4 is both more scalable and better
	  performing than its predecessor, and although it is still in
	  development, it is available for users of the Beta release
	  through a boot prompt option. For more details of the new
	  features in ext4, and how to test it in the Beta release,
	  see the features wiki

              pam_mount now uses a config file written in xml.
              <code class="code">/etc/security/pam_mount.conf</code> will be
              converted to <code class="code">/etc/security/pam_mount.conf.xml</code>
              during update with
              <code class="code">/usr/bin/convert_pam_mount_conf.pl</code>, this will
              remove all comments. If you use per user config files,
              they need to be converted manually (you can use the
              conversion script, off course). A sample
              pam_mount.conf.xml file with detailed comments about the
              available options can be found at
		<code class="code">/usr/share/doc/pam_mount-*/pam_mount.conf.xml</code>.
