                <h3>Chris, Java Web Application Developer</h3>
		<p><em>Chris Bredsen is a Java developer from Ft. Lauderdale who uses Fedora as his primary development platform. Chris gives his top 5 picks of tools in Fedora for Java development, as well as advice for Java developers considering a move to Fedora.</em></p>

		<img src="/static/images/using/interviews/chris.jpg" alt="Chris Bredesen" />
		<h4>Where are you from?</h4>
		<p>Ft. Lauderdale, FL. Living in Holly Spring, NC currently.</p>

		<h4>What is your profession?</h4>
		<p>Principal Software Engineer at <a href="http://redhat.com">Red Hat</a>.</p>

		<h4>What's your IRC nick?</h4>
		<p>When I'm on Freenode/Codehaus, etc, I use 'cbredesen' so as to be  transparent about my identity.  Here at Red Hat, I go by 'breddy' which  is a casual shortening of my last name given to me by a college buddy. I decided to keep it as a nick because it is vagurly similar to the first name of one of my Norwegian ancestors, Brede, (from whom my last name is derived).</p>

		<h4>How did you first become a Java developer?</h4>
		<p>My degree is in Computer Science but I'd not been interested in a career in software development for whatever reason so I went down the sysadmin path.  I had been doing server administration for many years, building mainly departmental and corporate Windows networks.  I decided to get back into programming around 2001 and, due to circumstances, moved into a role doing Visual Basic development.  Not long after I joined, we changed platforms from VB/C++/Windows to Java/*NIX/Linux.  The rest is history.</p>

		<h4>When did you first start using Fedora?</h4>
		<p>Most of my development career has been devoted to the architecture and development of mid- to large-scale web-based e-commerce systems.  That sort of work takes most of my time but I've got a few related projects in the works that I intend to release to the community and hopefully package for Fedora.</p>

		<h4>Tell us which 5 applications in Fedora you find most helpful for Java development in Fedora. What does each app do?</h4>
		<p>In no particular order:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>OpenJDK</strong> - having a high-quality, open-source JVM installed and updated in Fedora is a huge benefit.</li>
			<li><strong>Eclipse</strong> - my IDE of choice, packaged in Fedora.</li>
			<li><strong>Git</strong> - amazing distributed version control system.</li>
			<li><strong>bash/zsh</strong> - I can't effectively do my job without a real shell. :)</li>
			<li><strong>meld</strong> - Nice visual diff tool.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h4>Tell us about some interesting desktop customizations you've done to your Fedora desktop to help your Java development workflow.</h4>
		<p>I've spent significant time in GNOME, KDE and XFCE.  I've customized the desktop environment in many ways and arrived back at a fairly vanilla GNOME setup with Gnome-Do as a launcher.  The only real customization I've done to the system I've flirted with is moving from Bash to Zsh due to some of the built-in command completion that Zsh offers.  Most of the 
workflow involved in creating Java appolications is to do with the code/test/commit cycle made possible with Git, Maven and some of the other tools we use.</p>

		<h4>Can you tell us about a Java application you recently made using Fedora?</h4>
		<p>I'm currently leading development of the <a href="http://access.redhat.com">Red Hat Customer Portal</a>.  This is a group of applications tied together by a Seam web application built on Fedora and running on JBoss Enterprise Application Platform and RHEL. You can visit it at <a href="http://access.redhat.com">http://access.redhat.com</a>.</p>

		<h4>If you have a co-worker who doesn't use Fedora, can you still work on the same Java project together? How does that work?</h4>
		<p>Absolutely!  The Java Virtual Machine is available for all major platforms and the same code runs anywhere.  In fact my current team  consists of a graphic artist running Mac OS X - he's got a full copy of the <a href="http://access.redhat.com">Red Hat Customer Portal</a> running and connected to our Git repository.</p>


		<h4>Do you have any tips for enthusiastic future Fedora Java developers taking their first steps in using Fedora to create awesome Java apps?</h4>
		<p>Just to be aware that many of the tools that Java developers already know and love are available right out of the box in Fedora.  A dev workstation that would take me hours or even days to build with Windows or Mac OS X can be installed and running in less than an hour, thanks to Yum and all the great OSS software that Fedora has built and packaged.</p>

		<h4>Thanks, Chris!</h4>
