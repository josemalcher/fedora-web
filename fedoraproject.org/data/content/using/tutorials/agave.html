                <dd>-To start the Agave program click <b>Applications > Graphics > Agave</b></dd>

                <dd>-You will see a window like the following. Next you must choose a color, there are two methods to pick a color, either click on the button that will bring up a dialog. Using the eyedropper tool you can choose a color. The 2nd method is to select a base color by using the color palette located at the bottom part of the window. Now to add your own custom palette. You must first create a palette file. In my example is the format to create your custom palette:</dd>
		<p> <img src="${path}/static/images/tutorials/agavescreen2.png" alt="agave2" /> </p>
                <dd>-All palette files must start with the GIMP Palette header and a palette name. You can optionally include a comment starting with a #. The remaining lines define individual colors' red, green, and blue components ranging from 0 to 255.</dd>
		<p> <img src="${path}/static/images/tutorials/agavescreen.png" alt="agave" /> </p>
		<p> <img src="${path}/static/images/tutorials/agavescreen3.png" alt="home" /> </p>
                <dd>- You must create your palette file with a text editor like Gedit.Your palette file should be saved with a .gpl extension and saved in home directory at /home/example/.local/share/agave/palettes/. As you can see in the above screenshot. If your file is well-formed, Agave will load your custom palette next time you restart the application.</dd>
