                <h3>Building beautiful color palettes for your home and wardrobe</h3>

		<h4>Installing Agave</h4>
		<a href="${path}/static/images/tutorials/agave-install-full.png"><img src="${path}/static/images/tutorials/agave-install_thumb.png" alt="" /></a>
		<p>If you have never used Agave before, you'll need to install it:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Open up the Add/Remove Software wizard by selecting the <strong>System → Administration → Add/Remove Software</strong> desktop menu item.</li>
			<li>The Add/Remove Software wizard will appear. (See screenshot on the right.)</li>
			<li>In the search box in the upper left, search for <strong>Agave</strong> and click the "Find" button.</li>
			<li>Check the Agave checkbox on the right, and click on the "Apply" button in the lower right of the Add/Remove Software wizard.</li>
			<li>Once the Add/Remove Software wizard finishes, you should have Agave installed on your system!</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Now that you have Agave installed, go ahead and open it up by selecting the <strong>Applications  →  Graphics  →  Agave</strong> desktop menu item.</p>

		<h4>Picking a base color for your first palette</h4>
		<img src="${path}/static/images/tutorials/agavescreen1.png" alt="" />
		<p>At the right, you'll see a screenshot of Agave. Your Agave window should look something like this, although you likely won't have any favorite palettes saved in the right panel.</p>
		<p>The first thing you'll want to do is to choose a base color for your palette. From this base color, Agave can automatically generate a number of different harmonious color palettes using multiple techniques. So let's pick that base color!</p>
		<p>There are two main ways to pick a base color, using the color chooser button or using the palettes along the bottom of the window.</p>
		
		<h5>Color chooser methods</h5>
			<p>Click on the small button on the left side of the Agave window, immediately above the 'Palette' label. That will bring up the <strong>Pick a Color</strong> dialog.</p>
			<h6>Want to visually explore the color possibilities?</h6>
			<p>You may drag the small black circle within the triangle on the left of the <strong>Pick a color</strong> dialog to change the color's shade, and drag it circularly around the rainbow to change the hue of the color.</p>
			<h6>Want to pick a color you like from a photo or other graphic?</h6> 
			<p>Keep the <strong>Pick a color</strong> dialog open. Open up the graphic you'd like to pick a color from. It can be in a browser window, image viewer, or email client - it really doesn't matter, it just needs to be on screen. Now, click on the small eyedropper icon button in the lower left of the <strong>Pick a color</strong> dialog. Your mouse pointer will turn into a little color dropper icon. Hover your new dropper mouse pointer over the graphic you want to pick a color from, and click on the area that has the color. The <strong>Pick a color</strong> dialog will update and show the color you picked.</p>
			<h6>Have a specific color code in mind?</h6> 
			<p>Using the <strong>Color name:</strong> field in the <strong>Pick a color</strong> dialog, you can enter in HTML Hex color codes (They look like this: #FFCC00). You may also enter in manual Hue/Saturation/Value or Red/Green/Blue color values. This is helpful if you've picked a color in another graphics program or in HTML and want to generate a palette of more colors that will work with it.</p>
			<h6>Finishing Up</h6>
			<p>Once you've picked the color you like, click on the <strong>OK</strong> button in the lower right of the <strong>Pick a color</strong> dialog to set the color.</p>

		<h5>Palette methods</h5>
			<p>Agave comes pre-loaded with a set of large color palettes. They include "Visibone," "Tango Icon Theme Palette," "GNOME Icon Palette," and "Web Safe Colors." There is a <strong>Palette</strong> dropdown in the lower left of the main Agave application window. You can pick between these palettes from that dropdown. Once the palette is visible, you can hover over the colors in the palette to view their HTML hex codes, and you can click on any color with the hand icon to set that color.</p>

	<h4>Exploring your first palette</h4>

		<p>Now it's time to dig into your base color and discover what kinds of color palettes you can create with it. There are three main ways you can work with your base color to generate palettes - changing the color scheme of the palette, changing the saturation of the palette, and changing the brightness of the palette.</p>
		<h5>Changing the color schemes</h5>
		<img src="/static/images/tutorials/agave-color-relationships.png" />
		<p>You can change the number of colors in the palette associated with your base color by changing the scheme between the colors. Depending on the relationship you choose, Agave will select between one to three companion colors for your base color. Here's a summary of the color schemes you can choose from. Choose between these via the dropdown in the center left of Agave.</p>
		<ul>
		<li><img class="left" alt="" src="/static/images/tutorials/agave-color-complements.png" /><strong>Complements</strong> - complementary colors are opposite each other on the color wheel.</li>
		<li><img class="left" alt="" src="/static/images/tutorials/agave-color-splitcomplements.png" /><strong>Split-Complements</strong> - A split complements color scheme is a three-color scheme, involving a base color, and two colors that are equidistint from the base color and its complement.</li>
		<li><img class="left" alt="" src="/static/images/tutorials/agave-color-triads.png" /><strong>Triads</strong> - Triad color schemes involved three colors that are equally spaced along the color wheel, and you can draw a regular triangle between them.</li>
		<li><img class="left" alt="" src="/static/images/tutorials/agave-color-tetrads.png" /><strong>Tetrads</strong> - A tetrad color scheme in Agave simply involves four colors evenly spaced around the color scheme, such that you could draw a square between them.</li>
		<li><img class="left" alt="" src="/static/images/tutorials/agave-color-analogous.png" /><strong>Analogous</strong> - An analogous color scheme in Agave is a three-color scheme of three adjacent colors.</li>
		<li><img class="left" alt="" src="/static/images/tutorials/agave-color-monochromatic.png" /><strong>Monochromatic</strong> - Monochromatic color schemes in Agave involve three colors, all of the same hue, but with different brightness levels.</li>
		</ul>

		<h5>Changing the saturation of the palette</h5>
		<img class="left" alt="" src="/static/images/tutorials/agave-saturation-control.png" />
		<p>Once you've picked a color scheme you like, you can tweak the saturation of the palette by pressing the up and down saturation icons in Agave as shown in the screenshot. Toning down saturation in a color palette can convert your palette from having very deep rich colors, to having very delicate and slight tones. Changing the saturation of a palette is a technique you can use to change its mood.</p>

		<h5>Changing the brightness of the palette</h5>
		<p>Tweaking the brightness of a palette is another way to change the mood and feeling of a color scheme. By pressing the up and down brightness icons in Agave as shown in the screenshot, you can turn the brightness of all colors in the palette up or down.</p>

		<img class="left" alt="" src="/static/images/tutorials/agave-brightness-control.png" />

		<h5>Saving your palette &amp; using it!</h5>
		<img src="/static/images/tutorials/agave-favorites.png" />
		<p>Once you've got a palette you're happy with, the simplest way to save your palette is to press "PrtSc" on your keyboard to create a screenshot of the color scheme that you can print and bring to the store to pick out clothing or decorations for your home. 
		</p>
		<p>However, it's very useful to keep a list of your favorite colors handy in Agave. You'll notice a screenshot of the Agave favorites pane. To save your full palette here, color-by-color:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Double-click on the first color of your palette. It should have a thick black border around it to indicate that it is selected.</li>
		<li>Press the <strong>+</strong> icon on the bottom of the "Favorites" pane on the right of Agave's window.</li>
		<li>Repeat this process until you've saved each color in your favorites pane.</li>
		<li>If at any point your color palette changes during this process, you can press the <strong>Back</strong> button in the upper left of the application to go back to your color palette.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>You can save all of your favorite colors in the Gimp palette file format (GPL) by visiting the <strong>File → Export Favorites...</strong> item in the Agave main menu. You may import this palette into the Gimp graphics application - <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-palette-dialog.html">the Gimp manual has more information on this process</a>.</p>
