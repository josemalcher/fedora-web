    <h3 class="question">${_("How does it work??")}</h3>
    <p class="answer">${_("BFO was started by boot.kernel.org (BKO) and combines a series of recent technologies to produce a new boot stack.  The glue that holds everything together is gpxe.  Users familiar with pxe will find gpxe very familiar.  Latest versions support several protocols beyond just tftp.  We are using http to transfer files around.  The basic steps are as follows:")}</p>
    <ul>
        <li>${_("Download and boot from the boot.fedoraproject.org media.")}</li>
        <li>${_("Boot from the downloaded iso/disk image.")}</li>
        <li>${_("The disk image will then boot and configure network.")}</li>
        <li>${_("After network is configured, it will go out to our boot.fedoraproject.org website and download the menus and other prompts from us")}</li>
        <li>${_("Those boot menus will then be displayed to the user for selection.  After a selection (like install Fedora 12) the regular boot process takes over just as it would had you booted from normal local media.")}</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="question">${_("How do I use it?")}</h3>
    <p class="answer">${_("First download one of the available images like the ISO image.  Then burn that image to CD or DVD.  Next boot from that CD or dvd.  After that you're using BFO!")}</p>
    <h3 class="question">${_("Why should I use BFO?")}</h3>
    <p class="answer">${_("The BFO downloads are very small and once you have them, you'll rarely have to download more.  Even as more versions of Fedora come out, you just boot from your iso and they will appear.  Users with fast internet connections will have the best experience with BFO.  They basically replace having to regularly download large ISO images and burn them to disk.")}</p>
