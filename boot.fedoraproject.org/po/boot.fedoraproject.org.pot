"First download one of the available images like the ISO image.  Then burn"
" that image to CD or DVD.  Next boot from that CD or dvd.  After that "
"you're using BFO!  Use your keyboard to select menus to run diagnostics, "
"or boot a Fedora installer or rescue mode."

"BFO was started by boot.kernel.org (BKO) and combines a series of recent "
"technologies to produce a new boot stack.  The glue that holds everything"
" together is gpxe.  Users familiar with pxe will find gpxe very familiar."
"  Latest versions support several protocols beyond just tftp.  We are "
"using http to transfer files around.  The basic steps are as follows:"

"Those boot menus will then be displayed to the user for selection.  After"

msgid "Why should I use BFO?"
msgstr ""

#: data/content/faq.html:25
msgid ""
"The BFO downloads are very small and once you have them, you'll rarely "
"have to download more.  Even as more versions of Fedora come out, you "
"just boot from your iso and they will appear.  Users with fast internet "
"connections will have the best experience with BFO.  They basically "
"replace having to regularly download large ISO images and burn them to "
"disk."

msgid "What is required?"

#: data/content/faq.html:27
msgid ""
"For the most typical setup one should have DHCP, HTTP internet access and"

msgid "Does BFO replace the installer or anaconda?"
msgstr ""

#: data/content/faq.html:29
msgid ""
"Nope.  BFO is a way to load the installer via network.  Normally users "
"download a large ISO image that contains all of the installer bits.  BFO "
"is a smaller booting method that downloads the installer bits at runtime."
"  In theory with BFO one iso download can install all future versions of "
"Fedora."
