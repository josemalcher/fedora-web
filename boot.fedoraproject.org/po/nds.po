"First download one of the available BFO specific images like the ISO image."
"  Then burn that image to CD or DVD.  Next boot from that CD or dvd.  After "

#: data/content/faq.html:23
msgid ""
"BFO was started by boot.kernel.org (BKO) and combines a series of recent "
"technologies to produce a new boot stack.  The glue that holds everything "
"together is gpxe.  Users familiar with pxe will find gpxe very familiar.  "
"Latest versions support several protocols beyond just tftp.  We are using "
"http to transfer files around.  The basic steps are as follows:"

"Those boot menus will then be displayed to the user for selection.  After a "

msgid "Why should I use BFO?"
msgstr ""

#: data/content/faq.html:32
msgid ""
"The BFO downloads are very small and once you have them, you'll rarely have "
"to download more.  Even as more versions of Fedora come out, you just boot "
"from your iso and they will appear.  Users with fast internet connections "
"will have the best experience with BFO.  They basically replace having to "
"regularly download large ISO images and burn them to disk."

msgid "What is required?"
msgstr ""

#: data/content/faq.html:34
msgid ""
"For the most typical setup one should have DHCP, HTTP internet access and a "
"CD/DVD burner.  Floppy and USB images are also available."

#: data/content/faq.html:35
msgid "Does BFO replace the installer or anaconda?"
msgstr ""

#: data/content/faq.html:36
msgid ""
"No.  BFO is also not part of Anaconda.  BFO is a way to load the installer "
"via network.  Normally users download a large ISO image that contains all of"
" the installer bits.  BFO is a smaller booting method that downloads the "
"installer bits at runtime.  In theory with BFO one iso download can install "
"all future versions of Fedora."

msgid ""
"BFO uses gpxe so it's not actually booting a Linux kernel at first.  As "
"such, some drivers and devices may not be supported.  If this is the case "
"for you please check upstream at http://etherboot.org/ for bug updates, etc."
"  If you feel a bug or device is supported but not working in BFO, contact: "
